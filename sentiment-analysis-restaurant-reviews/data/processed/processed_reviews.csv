American Wild Wings,"*Visit By Invite*

Located in a buzy spot, this joint has definitely some good food to offer.

We tried a host of items from the menu. Starting off with Chicken Nuggets which were the show stopper. Next up we had Chicken wings, which to be honest didn't excite us too much apart from the barbeque chicken wings.

Fried Chicken burger had a tender and juicy patty served along some good french fries. Chicken popcorn were a major disappointment and the raw material used didn't look fresh. Chicken drumsticks gave nice visual as well as taste appeal. To keep the show running, we had caesar salad on the side which definetly requires a revamp and the joint can play with salad dressings, spices rather than having it served just with mayo.

In the end, we had Biryani which gets served under the brand of Fireblast Biryani. This biryani has still a long way to go and in order to beat the best of Biryani's in town need some more experiments with flavors.

While food here is decent, the ambiance requires immideat attention. The entrace was cluttered and the back of counter was clogged with unwanted items. A bit of touch up in both food and ambiance can turn this into a 5 star rating experience. #TheWandererFoodies

Labonel,"I have been lusting after this place, after reading too many 5 star reviews on Zomato.  So yesterday the occasion was right  and I was in the mood to splurge and enjoy some quality stuff with my SO. Unfortunately, I was utterly disappointed with the service that they had to offer. The staff at Labonel don't know anything about customer service.They were very rude and mean to us. I wanted to check their catalog but the person was behaving as if I was there to steal their products. Very impatient and unwilling to help. And also their phone number never works. Tried calling several times and never got a response. Anyways coming to food. I only ordered assorted collection of cupcakes The price burnt a hole in my  pocket. Only 15 tiny cupcakes for 850rs. The flavors are vanilla, chocolate and red velvet with vanilla and chocolate frosting. I tried the vanilla and chocolate so far and I  can say that chocolate cup cake is just fine, nothing special or out of the world experience like some other reviews claim it to be. Vanilla cupcake was dry and tasteless. Yes it was like eating a sponge(I am not saying that the cupcakes was as soft as a sponge it was as tasteless as a sponge). Nothing but just hype . I have had better cupcakes for a lot less money in small bakeries.

eat.fit,"AVOID. This place is a scam. If there is even a place: I cannot find the physical restaurant on google maps by the provided address. Anyway, I ordered a healthy chicken breast dish. They claim to offer healthy dishes and organic ingredients which look fantastic on the photos. Then you get regular oily fatty suspiciously-saucy Indian takeaway full of sugar and complex carbohydrates, probably from some nearby restaurant or street food stand. The only healthy thing about it was the size of the portion. No wonder it is low on calories: you can literally finish the whole plate in 4 bites. There were exactly 2 small chunks of chicken on it, maybe 25gr total, submerged in some ketchup based sweet sauce. I doubt it was even grilled. It looked and tasted more like it was fried, although with the disgusting oily sauce sugar coating it all who knows.

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,"Came here for some late night dinner and my experience can be termed ""Pathetic"" to say the least. They do not believe in serving a glass of water unless specifically asked for after 20 minutes of being there. The smell of the cleaning liquid was so strong that i lost my appetite and to top it gave me a splitting headache. Although they claim it to be open 24 hours, they apparently start cleaning up the place around midnight. Customers be damned! I asked them to pack up the food because there was no way i was going to eat from there bearing the mind numbing smell. After the food parcel was given, they wouldn't give me the cheque unless of course, again specifically asked for.

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,"Great place to enjoy your weekend. The food is amazing. Even had live music on Sunday.
We opted for à-la-carte and ordered Dahi ke Kabab, Thai Basil Praws, Fresh Lime Soda, Strawberry Mocktail, Penne Arrabiata and Chocolate Fondue Cake.
Dahi ke Kababs were very nice and soft like they should be. Thai Basil Prawns were also nice and tasty. They were properly cooked and well served. Fresh lime soda was.....well fresh lime soda but Strawberry Mocktail was super sweet and is a must try. Penne Arrabiata pasta is one dish that I would recommend you all to try here. The gravy was super thick and delicious, the pasta was boiled perfectly and the presentation was also good. Coming to the dessert, I never had such an amazing fondue, not too sweet, just the prefect balance of chocolate and sweetness. Overall had an amazing time here.

Bamboo chicken has good flavors but was more than mildly spicy. It is served directly from the bamboo box it is cooked in. It also has dry gravy so it's not entirely a good choice for starters, will go well with any Indian bread.
Pachi Mirchi kodi pulao was awesome. The rice was flavorful. Chicken curry served over it was semi - gravy and yummy as well. The chicken was nicely complementing the rice.

American Wild Wings,"American Wild Wings is another fast food joint located amidst the Cream Stone outlet of Gachibowli. The place is open and has an ideal sitting space for 20-30 people. Went there with my friends to try out their food. I found their Ambiance quite ordinary and I felt it can get some makeover.

Starting with their appetizers, We first tried out their in house Chicken wings. So, the chicken wings served over here are classified into various types. They offer a wide range of sauces for their wings ranging from classic Texas BBQ, Pattaya Thai, Spicy Garlic, Amazon wild etc.

My personal favorite of the lot had to be Original hot Chicken wings and Mexican wild Chicken wings. The wings were super juicy and delicious. However, I also feel that the sauce content was too much for the wings which can be slightly reduced in order to make it taste perfect.

Next up, we had their Classic Chicken Nuggets and Popcorn Chicken. The nuggets were super tasty and very much similar to what we usually get to eat at all fast food outlets. The Popcorn chicken was chewy. It requires serious attention and changes.

For mains, the place has also introduced authentic Indian dishes such as Chicken Biryani with Salan, Raita and Gongura Chicken. The Gongura Chicken was an absolute relish. To my surprise, the meat fell of the bone quite nicely and it worked really nicely with the clean flavors of the Biryani.

Thanks for a wonderful time Mr. Srinivas. Moreover, this place is comparatively quite pocket friendly and can be given a shot for their Chicken Wings anyday.

Arena Eleven,"Arena Eleven is a sports bar ,located at the plush and financial province of Hitec city .There is plenty of seating both indoor and outdoor. The menu is extensive. There is plenty of waitstaff. Our waitress frequently stopped by to make sure we were satisfied, and refilled soda and water drinks without being requested to.
We say outside seating gives you are brief view of the surrounding areas and the view is simply beautiful playing. The music selections were good, but not too loud.
The portions were very generous. .
There are many TV screens for sports viewing indoor, and even a few outdoor.
An overall good atmosphere..They have a buffet and alacarte kind of system here ..upon ourvisit here we tried their buffet and ordered few delicacies from their Alacarte menu as well ..the food the drinks everything was on point .one can surely enjoy this place at any time of the day .as this place is a sports bar as such the reservation is recommended during any sport featurings .do head to this place if you are a sports buff and if yournt one as you will have a great time at this place

Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,"*one of the best brunches.. People with a sweet tooth.. You should go👌👍*

Food - 6/7
Ambiance - 5/7
Service - 3/7

Feast is one of the biggest spreads I saw in a buffet.. It has continental, Chinese and Indian cuisine and chats with a huge variety.. The ambiance is decent.. But Probably it could be improved..

I would like first start with the desserts section.. There are many.. The very sight can be deadly to a diabetic patient.. Perfect place for ppl with a sweet tooth.. A big selection of pastries, cheese cakes along with many Indian specialties..

There was chicken, fish and mutton for starters.. I couldn't see prawns.. Chicken popcorn was so crispy on the outside and the chicken soft in the inside.. The best starter of all.. The other starters are okeyish..

The place is a bad maintained one in terms of staff and food. A donut shop must have sugar glazed donuts at all times, but initially they refused to serve one.

Finally the donut I had was the Caramel Vanilla, the donut was first served cold despite telling them to heat it. The donut anyways turned out to be a good one, perfectly sweet and hot. The caramel however was not upto the mark.

For the drink I had Vanilla Macchiato, the drink was way different from illustration. It lacked the caramel sauce on top and almost had no taste of vanilla, we also ordered for classic macchiato which tasted the same. So there was no vanilla in my coffee.

Great food, service and hospitality. They had live music elate the already beautiful and well lit ambience! I'd suggest a dinner at this place with your close ones! Better to reserve a table in advance.

Lovely taste in food. Delicious mushroom soup and the Quattro Formaggi is a wonderful burst of different cheeses in your mouth! Loved the appetizers and desserts as well.

NorFest - The Dhaba,"Have been to this place and also ordered from here. This place serves one of the best Awadhi and Punjabi dishes in Hyderabad. This is located in the food court of SLN Terminus mall. Loved their butter chicken which went really well with Tandoori Roti. Galouti kebab was awesome as well and went really well with the paratha served.

Ordered Lucknowi dum pulao veg as well as Chicken today. Portion size for both was a little on the lower side. The flavors and taste were awesome. As soon as the food was in the house we could smell Awadhi cooking. They serve Boondi Raita with the pulao, this is a welcome break from the onion - tomato Raita that usually comes with Biryani.

Chinese Pavilion,"Bad rating is mainly because of ""Chicken Bone found in Veg food"" and is not acceptable for a Vegetarian.

To satiate Cravings for chinese food we headed to Chinese Pavilion and there was also a voucher available in Little app for Luncheon tray for Rs 310 (Veg) [well do not bother for the voucher as the price for Veg Luncheon tray is Rs 275/- + taxes in the restaurant itself).

The ambiance is decent and since it was noon, not many tables occupied so it was pretty quite.

It was Thrusday special (Veg):
Hot and Sour soup: was just OK - well it had sprouts which were crunchy in your mouth: something different.
Kimchi - salad (personally i'm never fond of it)
Potato in plum sauce - this was very good and well made
Brocolli, Baby corn, Mushroom in spicy sauce - this dish lived to its name 'too spicy'; but was fine with fried rice
Veg hakka noodles - was good
Veg fried rice

Overall the food tasted good until a piece of chicken BONE came into my friend's (he is pure vegetarian) mouth while eating noodles. It was such a disappointment and complete experience was ruined.
Well Management did apologise but surely they cannot put things correct and were offering of not using coupon but we surely don't want to visit the place again. I requested to see their kitchen if they really segregate pans for Veg/Non-veg cooking which Manager declined which makes me believe they don't.

Staff and service are fine but they really need to improve the segregation of Veg and Non-veg as in Indian Culture it means a lot.

Staff were friendly and patient, got a table we requested.

Coming to the food ordered Chicken Nasheman Tikka, Stuffed Tangdi Kebab and Fish Tikka for starters. All tasted good. Tried Pina Colada Mocktail which was fine but don't go with spicy food.For Maindish we were suggested to take Sizzling Chicken Tikka Biryani and was tatsy as suggested.
Ambaince was good with outdoor and indoor seating.

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,"Ambience: 5/5 (Both Indoors and Outdoors facility)
Value for Money: 3.5/5 (This is with respect to Sunday Brunch# costing Rs. 1200/- per person)
Staff Service: 5/5

Quality of Food: 5/5 Simply premium.Items I like the most are veg. maki (sushi), broccoli salad* from their regular menu.But even more outstanding are their live counter options such as Tawa Fish (Not your regular bland bone-less fish, but the way you eat fish at home) had some real flavour. Omelette, French toast, Pancakes were simply brilliant.
Variety of Food: 5/5 Enormous.This is where Jonathan's Kitchen truly excels, there has to be at least one item you will madly fall in love with. They claim to have over 60 items on their menu, which can be verified rather immediately upon looking at the serving table.
#In the name of unlimited drinks, there was no real variety to choose from. I couldn't even get my favourite soft drink Thums up (Franchise issue probably, I know), and on that particular day, there wasn't any option of Pina Colada.

Chinese Pavilion,"Chinese Pavilion in Banjara HIlls was the first Chinese restaurant in Hyderabad for me and I still have fond memories of the great authentic taste. So, when I heard that they have opened another restaurant in Gachibowli which is near to my home, I was excited and took my family to dinner. First of all, the ambience is a huge let down. It looked like any budget restaurant and I was thinking whether I should get out or go in. Finally, went in expecting some great food.
We ordered noodles, fried rice, a lamb dish and a brownie. First of all, the prices were exorbitant for the ambience and the overall experience. They are providing a 3* experience and asking for 4*/5* prices. The fired rice was great but the lamb was undercooked. The desert was a disaster. Overall, please avoid this restaurant.

Mathura Vilas,"this was our first visit to mathura villas. we had visited this place on the last day of navratri for dinner. they only had special navratri thali in their menu for thali so we decided to go with it. we were utterly disappointed with the food:
1) the thali was filled with sambar, green chutney and sweet chutney, 1 peas corn gravy, 1 alloo gravy, mixture, navratan kurma and dry banana veggie, sour curd, samudana vada, samudana khichadi, payasam, fruit salad

2) there was no dal, no kadi, or any orther sabji/gravy in the thali. except for the kurma and corn-peas sabji nothing was appetizing enough

3) welcome drink like chaas/jaljeera which is usually a part of any thali in india was not served. on asking the manager he tells us that chaas is a part of the thali but that they missed swrving us

4) only fruit salad and payasam was given to us in the thali. again we had to ask the waiters if they had served all that was a part of the thali. only after enquiring abt the items did they mention that there is yet another sweet which they forgot to include.

5) they only had plain rice for the thali

overall there was absolutely nothing ""special"" about the so-called ""special navratri"" thali !",0,"['first', 'visit', 'mathura', 'villa', 'visit', 'place', 'last', 'day', 'navratri', 'dinner', 'special', 'navratri', 'thali', 'menu', 'thali', 'decide', 'go', 'utterly', 'disappoint', 'food', 'thali', 'fill', 'sambar', 'green', 'chutney', 'sweet', 'chutney', 'pea', 'corn', 'gravy', 'alloo', 'gravy', 'mixture', 'navratan', 'kurma', 'dry', 'banana', 'veggie', 'sour', 'curd', 'samudana', 'vada', 'samudana', 'khichadi', 'payasam', 'fruit', 'salad', 'no', 'dal', 'no', 'kadi', 'orther', 'sabjigravy', 'thali', 'except', 'kurma', 'cornpeas', 'sabji', 'nothing', 'appetizing', 'enough', 'welcome', 'drink', 'like', 'chaasjaljeera', 'usually', 'part', 'thali', 'india', 'not', 'serve', 'ask', 'manager', 'tell', 'u', 'chaas', 'part', 'thali', 'miss', 'swrving', 'u', 'fruit', 'salad', 'payasam', 'give', 'u', 'thali', 'ask', 'waiter', 'serve', 'part', 'thali', 'enquire', 'abt', 'item', 'mention', 'yet', 'another', 'sweet', 'forgot', 'include', 'plain', 'rice', 'thali', 'overall', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'special', 'socalled', 'special', 'navratri', 'thali']",first visit mathura villa visit place last day navratri dinner special navratri thali menu thali decide go utterly disappoint food thali fill sambar green chutney sweet chutney pea corn gravy alloo gravy mixture navratan kurma dry banana veggie sour curd samudana vada samudana khichadi payasam fruit salad no dal no kadi orther sabjigravy thali except kurma cornpeas sabji nothing appetizing enough welcome drink like chaasjaljeera usually part thali india not serve ask manager tell u chaas part thali miss swrving u fruit salad payasam give u thali ask waiter serve part thali enquire abt item mention yet another sweet forgot include plain rice thali overall absolutely nothing special socalled special navratri thali,0.035251854741986305,0.036998971785156,0.9277491734728581

I tried the Red Velvet and Willy Wonka Icecreams. They are served on a cone which is also very crispy.
Willy Wonka is made from Chocolate, brownies, and nuts and it was amazing and so was the red velvet one. One ice cream is too heavy for a single person so try accordingly.

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,"The only reason this place gets a two is because they’ve got the best ambiance and the food in brunches is very very good. But trust me, they have to change their attitude towards the customers. We were 6 people went there by making a prior reservation for brunch and to continue till late evening after brunch. The reservation was confirmed, and it was all good until the brunch was over. We wanted to continue after brunch to dinner and we agreed to pay whatever we consume after the brunch hours. An hour later a guy comes and tells us to leave because they’ve reservations. I informed him that we made a reservation too but they denied to let us continue. However, we all agreed to leave and asked for bill. Here is the twist, the bill comes 30 mins later and there was no one to collect cash/card from us. They made us wait for more than 1.5 hours and all this while, no table was occupied. It was all EMPTY!

Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,"We went there for a Buffet Breakfast and it is definitely one of the best spreads. You think about a breakfast dish and it will be there be north Indian, south indian or english delicacies. It has it all.

The fact that there were no Mangoes (its the season) was quite disappointing. Also there could have been more varieties of Paratha as there was only one Subz Paratha.

The ambience is impeccable. They have indoor as well as outdoor seating. The indoor is very comfortable and the outdoor is fun with great view and kids play area.

Very courteous and polite staff.

Will definitely revisit.

The place is famous for their lunch/dinner buffet so hoping to have that the next time. 🙂",1,"['go', 'buffet', 'breakfast', 'definitely', 'one', 'best', 'spread', 'think', 'breakfast', 'dish', 'north', 'indian', 'south', 'indian', 'english', 'delicacy', 'fact', 'no', 'mango', 'season', 'quite', 'disappointing', 'also', 'could', 'varieties', 'paratha', 'one', 'subz', 'paratha', 'ambience', 'impeccable', 'indoor', 'well', 'outdoor', 'seat', 'indoor', 'comfortable', 'outdoor', 'fun', 'great', 'view', 'kid', 'play', 'area', 'courteous', 'polite', 'staff', 'definitely', 'revisit', 'place', 'famous', 'lunchdinner', 'buffet', 'hop', 'next', 'time', 'slightlysmilingface']",go buffet breakfast definitely one best spread think breakfast dish north indian south indian english delicacy fact no mango season quite disappointing also could varieties paratha one subz paratha ambience impeccable indoor well outdoor seat indoor comfortable outdoor fun great view kid play area courteous polite staff definitely revisit place famous lunchdinner buffet hop next time slightlysmilingface,0.06041309331836761,0.028346339896351044,0.9112405667852815

Do not go with their briyani picturs shown on website in reality its only rice packed in some big attractive boxesNever try biryani here , However we were shocked to find just one piece of mutton in the Biryani. Not sure how Behrouz expected us to consume the box full of rice with a small piece of mutton. We have decided not to order anymore from this restaurant. worst of a kind and never tasted such filthy biryani in my life , and secondly they are charging bomb price for such filthy biryani ie 379

We ordered schezwan noodles. We were served spoiled ones from the morning. It smelled stale, sticky to touch and yak in taste. Worst experience. Asked the waiter to taste a spoon so that he will come to know the pathetic taste. He tasted and took away calmly .
Though I just had one spoon of it and returned back still they charged for it.
We spoke to the short fat manager for the charge levied on the spoiled food served which we didn't even have. He spoke very carelessly and extremely rudely.

Food - 4/5
Ordered Pasta Alfredo, Primavera Pizza, Butter Naan(bad), Paneer Makhani. All items were good. My family loved them.

Ambience - 2.5/5 - Beautiful soothing lights. Average setup. Cant consider a very peaceful place, bit of noise with chattering and few confused waiters around. Waiting area isnt great with a wooden log to sit.

Service - 1/5 - This is one area that needs improvement, 5 of us were offered a table of 4. Would have managed, but it was too small, and with kids, situation became worse. we were served just once, no one came again to serve or to ask if we needed anything. It's supposed to be waiters waiting tables, but we were the ones waiting :)

Will I take my kids? - 3/5 - its less spicy, kid friendly menu, but there isn't much for kids to enjoy. And no finger bowls :(

Will I take my parents? - 3/5 - Elderly would like the place and menu options. Decent groups around. Options in North Indian, Italian etc are enjoyable for them.

Value for money - 3.5/5

Washrooms - 2/5.

Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,"There are places that deserve a 5 star but they're worth a single visit. This one's different. The restaurant experience was 5 star indeed and deserves multiple visits. The food taste and quality exceeded the expectations. The presentation was great. Nice and courteous waiting with quick service.

However, the security of the hotel (Sheraton) in which this marvellous diner was in, did not know that the hotel even had a restaurant called Zega. Also, there's no elevator from the underground parking space.

It was a 5 star experience for the restaurant, the ambience and the food. But I cannot say the same for the convenience at the main entrance.

Anyway. It's a must visit. I apologise for the 4 stars it easily deserves a 5.

Arena Eleven,"I visited this place with my wife on 16 March,2019.  Its located in SLN terminus. We were looking for a place to dine after our movie at Platinum, and we decided to give this place a try. Was it worth it, lets find out.

Ambiance
============
We entered this place around 10 pm on a Saturday night and this place was  literally bustling with crowd. They have several television screens set up at various nook and corners of the lounge, and all of them played sports channel, ranging from Cricket to Premier League Football. We were promptly seated at the Verandah. The view from there is quite something. We got seated in a semi lit corner. The place has a cozy feeling and good vibes. Liked it. Ratings - 4/5.

Service
============
Pathetic. Needs a lot of improvement. They took some time to produce the Menu, and then the waiter just didn't show up for the order, for next 15 minutes at-least. We ordered food and drinks. The food was delayed and drinks just did't come. We had to repeatedly ask the waiter to serve the drinks at-least, so that we can end our boredom. Luckily the food came soon after the drinks were served. When asked for the bill, they showed a mobile shot of the bill amount taken by the cashier, saying printer was faulty. Phew! Ratings - 1/5.

Food
============
Did food proved to be the Savior for the night? Read on.  We ordered a cranberry breezer, virgin mojito and couple of Pinacoladas(Yes, we took advantage of Gold membership). The virgin mojito was pathetic. Period.  The Pinacoladas were really good. We ordered for Sizzling Veg Tikka Platter, which was strictly okay.  Well the service and food really disappointed. Ratings - 3/5.

Value for Money
=============
We shelled out 1200 bucks for food and drinks, that too have taken the gold membership advantage. High pricing along with lousy service and strictly average food never go hand in hand. So no way its VFM. Ratings - 1.5/5.

Let's calculate,

Rating = (Ambiance + Service + Food + VFM)/4 = 2.375

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,"It was on my birthday I visted this place.
Ambience, service and location of this place is spot on..
Choice of menu is less and am sure they are clear about their strengths and they have curated the menu accordingly. Right balance of Indian, Chinese, etc
We ordered a Chicken starter which is very flavourful from the first bite and meat is juicy, succulent and fresh.
Chicken noodles is very subtle and at the same time very tasty.. Noodles looked freshly boiled and the veggies are as fresh as they can be.. :D You won't get this kind of flavour and taste to the noodles at many places.
Tried sushi for the first time.. It was served with a green pickle which is super spicy (a pinch of it can actually make you cry) and pickled ginger.. felt sushi is not made for my palate.. :D forgot to mention had hard time to eat with chopsticks.. finally had with fork and spoon.. LOL..
We ordered 2 mocktails as well which were not there in the menu, suggested by waiter.. both of them tasted good.. :) waiters could have been more attentive other than that no complaints..

The Tilt Bar Republic,"Hats Off to Tilt Republic Bar- The only Europeon Bar in Hyderabad for having such huge array of Beers from different parts of the World.

The Food, ambiance, service is exceptionally good but what really stands out is their beers.

When I say Food is good- in elaboration I mean from starters to main course to desserts everything is oh - so Delicious!

The liquor section Of Tilt is hands down the most rare one, I say this cause of the beers they offer. I am not a beer person but here the beers are like nothing I've had before.

The beers are imported from different parts of the world and specially from those areas cause you wouldn't get the taste elsewhere.

No no the story doesn't end here. One thing you wouldn't want to miss is...
THE SPECIAL SHOTS OVER HERE -
JENEVER- WAFFLE SMEETS ( My fav over here)

Dine O China,"It was a date with my girls who wanted to eat Chinese so we decided to go to Dine O China for the simple reason that it is close to home and it turned out that we chose a super place to have Chinese.
The restaurant is located in Gachibowli and is easy to drive to from ORR and has a proper basement parking so no issues even on the busy Gachibowli road; for me it is a major point of concern if I am driving on my own so at least parking was sorted.
We entered the restaurant and were warmly welcomed by a stewardess who took down our order and served us. It felt like by the women for the women. It felt comfortable that is all.
The seating arrangement is quite comfortable and I particularly liked the chairs as they were so comfortable. We ordered chicken drumsticks and honey chilli potato for starters and both the dishes were awesome. Kids liked the chicken drumsticks and finished the plate. They were juicy and done to perfection and my girls told me that they were fresh also. Honey chilli potato was crunchy and sweet and chilly just like it should be.
For our main course we ordered veg dimsums and chicken dimsums and mix Chinese chopsuey. Both the dimsums were tasty and the wrapping was quite thin so you could taste the filling which was quite substantial. But I would recommend that you have dimsums with the sauce that they serve with honey chilly potato. I find it tastes better with this chilly sauce rather than the sauce that they serve with dimsums.
The mix Chinese chopsuey has a mix of egg, chicken and seafood and the girls told me that they liked the taste of it.
For dessert we tried chocolate fried ice cream which can be given a pass as I didn't like it that much.
Infact we liked the food so much that we got chilli garlic noodles packed for dinner also. And also the girls could not finish the chopsuey so we got it packed and will now have it in dinner.
We liked the place very much and once the husband gets back to Hyderabad we are visiting this place again for sure.

Pity Zomato doesn't give me chance to review the place on my second visit. Like I mentioned we would come back to this place we went there yesterday afternoon for some snacks and got some dinner packed for ourselves. We tried chilli garlic fish, kids' favourite chicken drumsticks again, chicken satay and lemon chicken coriander soup and veg talumein soup. All of which was great.
We asked for crispy chilly baby corn which turned out to be too salty and on complaining the stewardess served us a fresh batch which was quite tasty.
Definitely a must visit place. Will be back again when I am craving for some yummy Chinese food.

"3B's - Buddies, Bar & Barbecue","Not worth it at all. Paid 500₹ just to end up eating curd rice for the night .

Went here last night, got a table for 3.
The service was extremely poor and slow .
The waiter.. brought ""warm"" water bottle on a summer day .. first dropped water on us while pouring water into glass .. asked for cold water .. he came back only after 3 reminders.
He was the only one around .. wearing a CSK T shirt.

When the starters started arriving I was shocked
The starters were extremely spicy and contained extreme amounts of garlic. Un bearable.
For a person who has stayed in Hyderabad all my life .. the waiter gives an explanation that this is how Hyderabadi food tastes.

Mushroom wasn't good ..spicy and nothing less.
Fish wasn't cooked
Chicken was toooo spicy
Crispy corn .. basic item.. was oily and under cooked.
Potato Cooked with its skin was again oily and totally bad

Panner didn't arrive at all

Water arrived

Left all food as it is on the plate and went got main course...
Biryani tasted like a spicy pulihora

Settled for curd rice

Icecream- asked for a butterscotch icecream with some ""gems""
Icecream was good but The gems were tasting like synthetic chocolate.. horrible .. had to spit in the plate and leave in a hurry

When I was about to leave the panner starter arrived .. I had a bite .. it was ok

But I had enough already

Everyone around my table were complaining too..
But no use ..
Useless place

Beyond Flavours,"My review of the place comes after multiple visits, that have spanned over 4 months. And now I can safely say that it's one of the good places around.
They're located near the Biodiversity signal, above Fabindia. There's ample parking for both two and four wheelers. The ambience is a bit dim after dark, and the seating is divided into various options, including a PDR section.
The menu design is in the shape of a bottle, and the array spans Continental, Chinese and Indian cuisines. Here's the list of things that I have tried, across all my visits

Panko Crumbed Mozzarella Sticks ❤️ - Cheese sticks that are coated and fried. Pure cheese bliss.
Veg Lasagna ❤️ - This place has one of the good Lasagne in the town.
Crispy Chilli Corn Kernels - The usual favourite, this one has a slightly different presentation here.
Makhmali Paneer Tikka -
Cottage Cheese Shashlik Sizzler
Italian Nachos - Nachos topped with red sauce and cheese, and baked in the dish.
Cheese and Cheese Pizza ❤️ - Soft base pizza, loaded with cheese, and a few pieces of green olives.

I cannot stress enough on how I have loved all that I tried here. I have also tried out their lunch buffet. The variety may not be as elaborate as other places, but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings, it is at least a one-time try. But what I really adore here is their mocktails. Beyond Delight is an absolute delight! Also a fan of the Guava and Chilli, and Apple and Kiwi Night drinks.

The staff is ever so courteous. A special mention to Papiya and Shuvro, who were our attendants on the latest visit. The place has Zomato Gold 1+1, which further brings down their reasonable rates.

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,"Mazzo, located on top of SLN Terminus, is the dining wing, for Marriott’s modern extended-stay apartment hotel.
Marriott is known for it’s hospitality, and you will experience that, here at Mazzo.

I went to Mazzo, for lunch on a sultry afternoon. The view by the pool was spectacular, and breathtaking.
I could totally see, how this can be the most perfect date place.

I had a continental meal, and boy was it amazing! I had a few dishes out of the menu, and complements to the chef, Amit, for getting everything so right.

I had Indian Shorba and Fish n Chips for starters; Pork Chops and Spaghetti Carbonara for my main course; and a Brownie with icecream for desert.

Every dish was fantastic. But the Fish n Chips and Pork Chops blew my mind.

The fish was delicious, and the batter was perfect.

The Pork Chops were extremely juicy, and cooked to perfection. The mashed potato was oh so buttery and dreamy. And, how can I forget that demi-glace sauce. Beautiful!

The spaghetti carbonara with bacon was love.

Plating was just so Marriot! Elegant yet simple.

And, all of this, while sitting in one of the most beautiful places in the city.

Marsala Food Company,"We went for a lunch outing here. It’s located at DLF. The ambience is good and we expected a good meal. We ordered Chicken Tangdi, Mutton Biryani and Coke. First thing we got was Chicken Tangdi and what I instantly noticed was that it was deep fried, which is not a norm and wasn’t juicy; all we could taste was charcoal. This made our expectations very low.

In the mean time, I asked them to get the Coke I ordered; it wasn’t chilled. Hence, I requested them to get Ice. To my surprise, they had no ice.

And finally, we got our biryani. It was not bad; but, there were no Meaty pieces of Mutton; Only bones.

Tempteys,"What I love about their shakes are they are not very high in sugar. So sugars don't kill the flavors expected in that shake...!!!

Tried:

poppy corn: Absolutely loved the flavor. You could get a clear flavor of popcorns. Would recommend to try if you love popcorns.

old granola (honey loops) Again amazing. One of the must tries.

berry cherry: Good amount of berries, great flavor. Recommended.
caramel Brownie: This was also pretty good. I am. personally not a caramel flavor lover, so not my fav.

coffee hazel nut: This was just WOW. must have for coffee lovers. They were really generous in putting the coffee in the shake :D. It had a strong coffee flavor. So if you are a true coffee lover you'll like it. ;)
Cheesecake (tuti fruity) : It had exactly tuti fruity flavor. Didn't like it much.
oreo and little hearts (cookie feast): Oreo shake never fails.. :) It was good.
Blueberry slush: I didn't like the slush though. it only seemed to have color but no taste.

Mint o fruit: I don't like mint flavors at all. And was ofc Minty. So not my fav. If you like mint flavors it's for you.

They have different toppings for french fries and potato wedges and they are all just soooo amazing... Must Try.

Hyderabadi Daawat,"A newbie in the neighborhood calls for a visit and it was a Sunday afternoon we landed.

A quick confirmation via Zomato led to happy welcome as we enjoyed the ambiance and amazing hospitality by the courteous staff.

Menu card was well organized with tabs to make your way through it easier. Earned a 1/2 star!

Ordered Pathar-Gosht and Afghan Kebab as wanted to start off light. As surprising as it can be the Afghan Kebab turned to be the way an authentic kebab should be and not the imitation ones that are spread across cities. Pathar-Gosht was mouth watering as the aroma of the spices was blended perfectly and not to forget the accurate chunk sized that melted right away in the mouth. Another Star earned for Starters.

When in Hyd go for Biryani- So how couldn't we as we ordered Biryanis - Chicken and Mutton. Prompt service by the staff ensured we had them served on our plats without much waiting time !

Taste was good as they took care that the Biryani don't fry away our taste buds or bring tears down eye. Happy to have tasted an amazing blend of aroma and well coked mutton n chicken pieces. Spices were evenly distributed and the texture was smooth and appealing. The colours of the rice was perfectly blended as it reflected the Typical Hyderabadi style.

With tummies full we ordered Blue Mojito and it too scored as expected...Amazing. Time for a wrap up as the Manager Mr. Dilawar greeted us with his hospitality. A true Gentleman he was as he assisted my family all throughout.

My View: An amazing yet serene restaurant to visit with Family and friends. Located conveniently in Main road to Gachibowli, Daawat is a must try if you're around or visiting Hyd. When in Daawat- don't forget to try their Pathar-Gosht and not to forget the Amazing Raan they boast of being their super speciality.

Hyderabadi Daawat,"This place is only a few months old. It's true that Hyderabad is filled with various food places that serve different cusines, mainly there are n number of Cafe's, bars, food joints. The new culture has out shined the basic restaurant culture.
Hyderabadi Daawat is that place which will bring back your memories of going to a restaurant to enjoy a good sumptuous meal with your family or friends.
It excells in real flavours used in Hyderabadi dishes and will make your mouth water for their signature dishes.
Starting with the mocktails section, there is a huge variety. From the basic mojitos to the flavoured ones. The signature mocktails and a must try outs are Mango Bloom, Soda Fountain and Strawberry Mojito.
Coming to the starters, it's the best to begin with some soup. Yakhni Shorba is the best try out soup.
Phucket fish, wok tossed chicken and Sholay Kebabs are the other three delicacies in the starters menu. Sikandari Raan.. the signature item from the menu is the show stealer. The presentation is so lovely that would not let you take a picture of it but to devour it immediately.
Heading to the main course, Hyderabadi cuisine is incomplete without biryani. This place has amazing Mutton biryani which is flavoured so well. The aroma is literally breathtaking. Chicken Tikka lababdar and Nihari Ghost are the other curry options which should be tried in the main course along with butter naan. The main ""main-course"" is Murg Massalam, a whole chicken stuffed with lamb and eggs. This dish was superb in taste as well as presentation. After a full on meal desserts are a must. Matka Firni and Double ka meetha were amazing here and should be eneded with after the meal.
The staff here is very polite and friendly. The ambience is serene and calm,goes well while having your meal here. The place has a huge space of sitting area. The indoors are done very finely with good cravings on the ceiling.
Overall its a place you can go to with your family for an amazing Lunch or Dinner.

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,"Reach out to @thehedonisticbhukkad on Instagram for more! :)

Visited this place for a rather late lunch, say somewhere around 3/4.

Ambience - Simply classic and sufficiently spacious (at least,we felt so because we were the only customers in the restaurant.) This place reeks of class & elegance from the moment you step inside the elevator. The place is brightly lit and relaxing. Though the rooftop view is breathtaking coupled with sitting by the poolside, we preferred sitting indoors.

Service - Gopal was our server for the day. Courteous and meticulous, he helped us with suggestions for dishes more suitable for our tastes. The staff overall seemed to be attentive and polite.

Food - We ordered two drinks(I can't recollect the names, sorry for that) and they arrived promptly at our table within no time. Ordered Caprese Bruschetta and Creamy Pesto Penne Pasta.
I've tried Bruschetta at other places but never savoured it the way I did here. The freshness of toppings was evident. The pasta was sufficient for two and that again, was a delight to eat. Had to rush,hence couldn't try the desserts.

Overall, dining at Mazzo is an indulgence.

American Wild Wings,"It is very rare that the food is so horrible that you have to leave it mid-way and post a review. 

I ordered Chicken Burger + Fries + Wings + Soft drink combo through Zomato, and received my order fairly quickly. However,
(1) Fries were totally cold and soggy. 
(2) Burger was average - tasted like the low-end 40 rupees burger at McDonalds.
(3) Wings were either burnt or double-fried. There were parts of the thick coating which were burnt black - and they perhaps tried to fix it by adding too much sauce on the top.

Looking at other reviews it feels like it might be once-in-a-while exception but they ruined my Monday Lunch!

Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,"Had a terrible exp on Saturday night (22nd Sep). I have been quite regular To komotos on Friday eve woh my office colleagues and had good exp so far. Tonight I recommended this place to my friend for dine out.

When my friend arrived the staff at the kitchen told there is no ala-carte tonight. Only option is buffet. So they started with buffet. When I reached it a little surprise to me and I checked with the manager there Mr. Abhiveer. He also denied about the ala-carte. So we continued with buffet later while walking around the buffet spread we learnt that ala-Carte is also there and three ppl lied to us. As I am a big fan of their Hamas and pita dish I asked for the menu and Mr. Abhiveer is sayin we don’t have menu, please check the menu in Zomato. What? Who the hell ll publish the menu only on zomato in a restaurant and are the customers fool enough?

Buffet food options for vegetarians are very less. Their dessert spread was good though.

Their service was also pathetic for the indian bread and other stuff. After asking numerous time for spoons and tissues, this is how the tissues were served to us on the table (plz refer the pic). We had 3 kids with us, imagine how long these tissues would have been their in this manner! 😀

10 Downing Street,"Absolutely loved the place! It's has a nice classic touch compared to the 10D in Begumpet which has become too crowded and lost it's charm.
You would change your opinion about 10D if you visit this place in Gachibowli.
Rooftop open air ambience, with comfy seating.
Service is faster compared to many other pubs in the neighborhood even though it's jam packed on a Friday night. They also have a separate section of seating for those who wish to sit and talk serious business, away from the music. The entire hotel which is on the 10th floor has got a royal and classy look.
Staff are courteous and know their menu well. Do ask them for suggestions if you're confused on which ones to choose.
It's got a separate dance floor and Bollywood on the clock after 11 is awesome! They play these retro vibes which all the 90s born adults would love!
Overall it's one of the best I've visited in a long time, will definitely be on my frequent visit list.

The service was so lethargic that I had to wait almost 30 minutes for my food on a day when only 3-4 tables were booked.
The only positive side of this place is the ambiance which is great, authentic artifacts from the past add a good aurora but the place needs to step up its game in terms of food that they offer.

I Visited with family felt very comfortable although it's a bar+kitchen. so, it's not the prefect place to hangout with gang but surely can have a try once .. initially we planned for ala carte , but went for buffet because ala carte seems expensive compared to other restaurants.. Peaceful experience no distractions what so ever..
prefer to have spicy food it's the best place to visit .. starters were amazing Fish was superb (Spicy) .

Club Rogue,"Recently been to this place. Good food and economically priced. Service was also good.
Most disappointing part is their crowd management. When they have a board outside only couples after 7.00p.m and then u see 60 percent dance floor is full with stags. No bouncers to check what is going on floor. Stags misbehaving with girls, trying to feel them, smoking on floor, no one is there to look around. Just for their business they r letting everyone in.
I will never visit this place with my wife/lady friend. As there is no security for them. One should enjoy the party but with some limits.
The management should look into this aspect and try to sort it out or else the place will become like its name a Rouge place.

Diners Pavilion,"The service was disappointing. The servers were in some hot mess - confused how to circulate the starters. We were five members, we got the table promptly as we had prior reservation. We decided to take the buffet. We were told that starters are being served pretty much like some other joints. The sitting arrangement in the restaurant is haphazard, mismatching furniture (probably some kind of interiors they thought to make a different style statement - which is not an issue for me). The welcome drinks were served only for 4 members in the beginning. Had to remind them to serve one more. Only three plates were provided, so after a wait of 5 minutes, the rest two of us got our plates. We told them, almost 3-4 different staff members, that two of us were opting for non-veg and three are vegetarian. They would either serve vegetarian options at a time or non vegetarian and then totally forget our table for 10-15 mins. We had to remind them to serve us more. Plus, they kept bringing the same starter again and again, despite telling us that there are other starters too. For e.g. crispy corns arrived at our table - I lost the count how many times! Some starters arrived only once. Some veg starters were cold !! Almost after 45 mins, the two chicken starters that they told us in the beginning arrived.  Main course was alright. After spending an hour, my appetite was already gone. I still made a selection of prawn curry, it was delicious. I had it with naan and some rice as well. Desserts were also running out of supply by the time we were ready for it. Overall, the whole excitement of having a team lunch at this place was lost, mostly due to poor service.",0,"['service', 'disappoint', 'server', 'hot', 'mess', 'confuse', 'circulate', 'starter', 'five', 'member', 'get', 'table', 'promptly', 'prior', 'reservation', 'decide', 'take', 'buffet', 'tell', 'starter', 'serve', 'pretty', 'much', 'like', 'joint', 'sit', 'arrangement', 'restaurant', 'haphazard', 'mismatch', 'furniture', 'probably', 'kind', 'interior', 'think', 'make', 'different', 'style', 'statement', 'not', 'issue', 'welcome', 'drink', 'serve', 'member', 'begin', 'remind', 'serve', 'one', 'three', 'plate', 'provide', 'wait', 'minute', 'rest', 'two', 'u', 'get', 'plate', 'tell', 'almost', 'different', 'staff', 'member', 'two', 'u', 'opt', 'nonveg', 'three', 'vegetarian', 'would', 'either', 'serve', 'vegetarian', 'option', 'time', 'non', 'vegetarian', 'totally', 'forget', 'table', 'min', 'remind', 'serve', 'u', 'plus', 'keep', 'bring', 'starter', 'despite', 'tell', 'u', 'starter', 'eg', 'crispy', 'corn', 'arrive', 'table', 'lost', 'count', 'many', 'time', 'starter', 'arrive', 'veg', 'starter', 'cold', 'almost', 'min', 'two', 'chicken', 'starter', 'tell', 'u', 'begin', 'arrive', 'main', 'course', 'alright', 'spend', 'hour', 'appetite', 'already', 'go', 'still', 'make', 'selection', 'prawn', 'curry', 'delicious', 'naan', 'rice', 'well', 'desserts', 'also', 'run', 'supply', 'time', 'ready', 'overall', 'whole', 'excitement', 'team', 'lunch', 'place', 'lose', 'mostly', 'due', 'poor', 'service']",service disappoint server hot mess confuse circulate starter five member get table promptly prior reservation decide take buffet tell starter serve pretty much like joint sit arrangement restaurant haphazard mismatch furniture probably kind interior think make different style statement not issue welcome drink serve member begin remind serve one three plate provide wait minute rest two u get plate tell almost different staff member two u opt nonveg three vegetarian would either serve vegetarian option time non vegetarian totally forget table min remind serve u plus keep bring starter despite tell u starter eg crispy corn arrive table lost count many time starter arrive veg starter cold almost min two chicken starter tell u begin arrive main course alright spend hour appetite already go still make selection prawn curry delicious naan rice well desserts also run supply time ready overall whole excitement team lunch place lose mostly due poor service,0.03269350567181513,0.0377843462308866,0.9295221480972984

My whole party got ruined because of their so called great service. I have given a bulk order and asked if they have home delivery, ofcourse there was none. I was okay with it and said I will collect it from their store. I almost travelled 20 km from my place to collect my @ order and due to heavy traffic, I reached the place exactly 5 min late from their closing time. I kept giving them information about how far I am and that I would reach them in less time. I requested them to wait for 5 minutes as I was travelling from habsiguda which is atleast 20km away from banjara hills. They answered my call at 9:00 when I was near GVKONE. I said I will come in 5 min they said they will wait. But, by the time I reach their place everything was locked. I called them 100 times and their was no response. What an awful service..!

Prism Club & Kitchen,"The new place in the financial district which everyone is talking about and is known for its dance floor as its USP.

I went here with my team on Friday night and booked upper deck for the same. The place no doubt is very spacious and has one of the best dance floors in Hyderabad. The light system and other props were good. It reminded me of Club Octagon in Gangnam, Seoul. Overall ambience is good with 2 levels of seating where ground floor can is suitable for small groups or couples and upper deck has sofa sets for bigger groups.

Food is just average here. Starters like paneer tikka, baby corn or chicken tikka were very greasy. Main course was also not upto the mark.

Worst thing I experienced about this place is the service.
I asked person attending us to start the main course at 8.30 pm. To which he replied it will take another half an hour to get the main course ready. It would have been fine if main course got started at the said time but after many more follow ups it started at 10 pm !! This really pissed me off and ruined whole experience.

I wanted to give 1 star but giving it 2 just because of ambience.

Royal Spicy Restaurant,"Since my childhood, I've always been a fan of gongura with non veg and when I got to know that this place serves a good Gongura Biryani, thought of having it.

And then comes a day when I finally ordered it and guess what, as soon as you see it, you'll fall in love with the colour of biryani 😍 Hopefully that is not an artificial colour. But coming to taste, it's awesome. Just lyk God is omnipotent, the flavour of Gongura is omnipresent😉 I mean in every rice grain you can sense it. The chicken pieces too were very good. They are soft too as one my friends who has a fence to her teeth😜 could eat those easily 😂
Tagged at a moderate price , quantity is quite sufficient.

If you're a lover of Gongura , then this a must try.

Marsala Food Company,"Visited this place for the first time (team of 7 people) after checking out the rating and reviews. Not at all happy with the management and the staff.

1. Added few items in between for which we were made to wait for more than 30min with no response whenever asked for. We cancelled the order finally and also were made to pay for the cancelled items (INR 500 extra for the items cancelled).
Reason stated by the staff - if you won’t pay, it will be deducted from our salary.
2. When asked for salad (thrice), no one served. Ultimately, one of us, went to the buffet section and got the onions. Even this wasn’t noticed by anyone.
3. Not happy with the quality of food. Ordered “papdi paneer kebab” as per the staff recommendation. It was dry and not good. We told the guy who served and got no response for our concern.
4. There are many staff members but lack of management.

American Wild Wings,"I ordered the signature chicken wings through zomato, which is 1xfrench fries, 6x chicken wings, and one coke(350ml).
Quantity was satisfactory.
Packaging of the food was good. I really liked how they packaged the coke, which was still a bit cold when it arrived. Some may call it excessive packaging however.
The fries were warm and well salted. But they were not crispy. This could be the fault of delivery, so I am not upset. Only 1 restaurant in zomato has so far managed to deliver crispy fries consistently.
The wings were covered in brown gravy. I was expecting crispy wings like in the photograph. While the wings were certainly not bad, I did not enjoy it very much.

So being a foodie both me and my wife, when we have the option almost every time we’ll choose the buffet. So did today. The food was delicious, almost every each item was tasteful, very few were on the average side. They have 3 main counters, one with asian food, one continental, and one with soup, salads and desserts. The have have live chat counter and they will cook pizza and pasta if you have a request. I think that the stars of the day were salami pineapple salad and the blueberry cheese cake.
Ambiance was peaceful and having the option of eating outside (al fresco - Italian) is always a plus. Service very good, staff was quick and helpful. All in all, a very good experience.

Hyper Local,"Review :

Recently we've received an invitation from Hyper Local. It's on the 3rd or Top Floor of SLN Terminus, Gachibowli, just next to Platinum Cinemas. The place is located in a good, open area and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer. And if you go there before Sunset, you can enjoy the dawn. The Ambiance is pretty good, with:

Full Bar

Nightlife

Live Music

Private Dining Area Available

Wi-Fi

Live Sports Screening

Indoor Seating

Smoking Area

Buffet

If you are looking for a full hangout with friends or office colleagues, this is the perfect place. Their food is pretty good, with reasonable price. I find the prices are on the lower side, than any other nearby cafes.

They are serving IPL Live Screening with Bucket Bonanza where you can get 4 pints of Beer including a veg/non-veg starter. But you need to remember the Entry is restricted to adults, no kids allowed.

Anyway, yesterday, I went to keep the invitation. It was around 6:15 pm and almost empty as the crowd starts after 8 pm anyday. I asked to serve their specialty, so they advised me to try thier special mocktail and cocktail. First, they served LSD, which is a kickoff cocktail, made with 5 types of liqueur, like Gin, Vodka, Tequila, Rum & Triple Sec. and made with freshly squeezed Orange juice. Triple sec is an orange flavored liqueur, made from the dried peels of bitter & sweet oranges. And with the use of Fresh Orange juice, the cocktail taste was so good and strong as well. I was eagerly waiting for the Mocktail. Thought of trying the non-alcohol drink first, then the cocktail. The mocktail was served along with Chicken Taco.

The mocktail was made with Fresh Kiwi & Mint. The flavor of fresh ingredients were significant, made the drink so refreshing. Usually in bars, they use the syrup but here they use the fresh ingredients which made their drinks really nice.

After that I tried their Chicken Taco. Those Tacos were made for Indians, so you can't get the blunt taste, but the real fusion works here. Those Tacos were stuffed with Indian spiced grilled Chicken and topped with mint raita and served in Malabar Ghee fried Parotas. Taste wise they were so good, but the only thing which bothered me, the Malabar Parota. As the parotas have layers, so it was difficult to hold the entire thing. so, I suggested to use plain Wheat Four/Maida Tortillas, I believe the taste will also go better with the Indian spiced Grilled Chicken. And yes, the Tacos were too filling, I could have only 2 of them.

Now it's time for the Cocktail, which was literally inviting me to taste it. And believe me it was kicking off,so strong, but nice Orange flavored & very refreshing. I could only finish the 3/4th of the entire portion.

The stuff were insisting me to try something else on food. I left it on them, so they suggested me to try their signature dish Chicken Sambousek, what is that? That is Baharat Spiced Chicken Keema cooked & folded in spring roll sheet and then deep fried. Served with 3 types of dip, Mayo, Mint raita & Sweet Tamarind & saffron chutney. I liked to try these Sambousek with sweet Tamarind chutney, it went so well together.

Now you might be wondering what Baharat spice is? As per the Chef, the word baharat actually means ""spices"" in Arabic and not a single spice, but a blend of several spices. In this blend you can find black pepper, coriander, paprika, cardamom, nutmeg, cumin, cloves, and cinnamon. So, the chicken keema was cooked with these spices. Though the Sombousek looks pretty similar with Samosa, but the taste was very different. And that's why the 3 different types of dips were served.

I felt the food quality & quantity is quite enough & satisfactory as per price. Definetly overall 4.5 out of 5.

Already written about the ambiance : 5 out of 5

Location is also easy to reach : 4.5 out of 5

Service was a Professional & efficient : 5 out of 5

As per my experience, young people have a great option for a Bar Cum Restaurant which serves both quanlity & quantity of food & dink on reasonable price, with nightlife & live screening & beautiful

After starters when we asked for main course, the staff told that on Friday they have only street food and no main course is available. Felt like we wasted our money.

Though the starters were good, but main course should also be there. Street food should be the add on and not the only food.

Two stars only for the ambience.

Olive Garden,"Been exploring about restaurants in Gachibowli and found this place. Been to this restaurant ordered chicken drumsticks and spl chicken biryani which tasted really good, finally ended with a good dinner. As the taste was good ordered a non veg combo next day and surprised to see a cockroach in the meal. It was really a bad experience to see a cockroach where the restaurant has taken away all the positive views that I had towards it. Please don’t play with health of customers, it takes time for anybody to order food again if we come across these situations.

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,"We wouldn't have found this gem of a place if we hadn't been at the mall opposite and looking for a place to have lunch. More than a month since we visited, but it was such a treat! The place is tiny, right on the road but still can be missed out if you are not looking for it.

The menu is pretty extensive, but going by our love for pork, we dove right into the traditional pork dishes on offer. We ordered Soba noodles with pork and veggies, Naga Pork curry (which came with rice) and then added some smoked fried pork with bamboo shoots.

The noodles were alright, but had sort of a maggi consistency - but there was enough pork to enhance the flavor. The naga pork curry was a revelation - spicy but so full of flavor, my daughter who is averse to spices ate a fair bit! The fried pork was delicious too, but an overkill, going by how we were already full with the first two dishes. 

We had ordered the flavored beer they have, which was refreshing but relatively overpriced. But just for the food, I think we need to visit again.

PourHouse7,"Today I visited this place called Pour House 7 in Gachibowli.The place has indoors as well as rooftop seating.The rooftop seating gives you a panoramic view of the area and is breezy and well lit.The indoor seating is more of like a party space which will be ideal for small to medium sized groups.Coming to the food it was really mind blowing.We tried a bunch of items and majority of them tasted great.Lets have a look at the items we tried starting from Mocktails to appetizers and main course and ending it with desserts.
Firstly we had Tandoori Malai Broccoli which literally surprised me.Who had thought Broccoli could be that tasty....It tasted amazing with a creamy taste to it.Next we had Crispy chapa which is basically crispy crump coated fried fish with curry leaves seasoning which gave it a unique flavour.This was an outstanding dish and all of us loved it.Morrocan Chicken sticks was our next item and this one was also pretty good.The chicken was slightly smoky with a good amount of spicy seasonings on top.The chicken was nice tender and juicy too.I love seafood and so I ended up ordering a Jhinga Nasheela...This tasted good but nothing extraordinary about it.It was just good that's it.We also had Chicken Nachos which was served in a big bowl with lots of cheese and salsa and the right seasoning.Loved it.We also had a Bruschetta which was average.Along with these we also ordered Aalishaan Chicken sandwich which I would say was not at all aalishaan.This was not good.It lacked the right amount of chicken in it and was overall not tasty.Next we had a Nawabi Chicken pizza and it was really good.The topping was great with lots of chicken and cheese and was true to its name but the down side of the pizza was its base.The pizza base was really hard and dry which overall brings down the dish but I still had it because of the amazing topping.We had a platter of Fish Fingers and fries and it was excellent.Both the fish fingers and the fries were good.
After devouring all these starters we could only go for two main course dishes and so we decided to go for the Special 7H Biriyani and Spaghetti Aglio-e-olio.I am in love with their biriyani.It was not like any other biriyani that I have ever tasted before.It was unique and it was excellent too.It has a completely different flavour from all the other biriyanis in Hyderabad and I could not guess what's the secret ingredient was.The spaghetti I would say was decent but was definitely not among my favourites.
Now coming to the desserts we had vanilla ice cream and Gulab Jamuns.I would say the dessert section does not provide for much choices.The Jamuna were decent.
We also had some moctails in between which were not up to the mark.They need to improve their moctails.The only one I felt was perfect was the Virgin Mojito.Other Mocktails we had were not good.We had some litchi based ones and orange based ones and also a pinacolada flavoured one.But we did not like these much.

Overall I would say that the place offers really good food and the ambience is also great.The drinks need immense improvement.Thats it folks.This was my review of the place.Hope you like

Hyderabadi Daawat,"The name is a giveaway here! This place specialises in Hyderabadi cusinie and we were here for a food review session.
Ambience- Decent with ample space. It's a fine dine place you can visit with your family.
Food- This place has lots of splendid non vegetarian options but being a vegetarian, my review revolves around their veg food and beverages.

The food was well prepared and presented overall. I liked the achari paneer tikka in starters. Shahi paneer was my favourite among the main course that went well with their mix roti Basket. Two of my favourite beverages from the evening were Caramel Mojito and Lemon Mint.

The menu is vast and really reasonable. Do not miss this place if you like Hyderabadi cusinie. Even if you're not a fan, do give them a chance as they have a lot to offer at really humble rates.

Banana Leaf Multicuisine Restaurant,"hank you so much for taking such wonderful care of our family during our visit to the Bananaleaf Restaurent You and your staff were so very accommodating and informed about your special dishes. The food at your restaurent was delicious!

My son had a wonderful time and liked that he could order special food and the chef would make it so he could eat it. If you wouldn’t mind telling me how you prepared the fish, I would like to try making some for him at home, since he enjoyed it so much.He said that he wanted to have his birthday party at here!

My son and my mom enjoyed their desserts as well. Thank you also for having the special Jamoon for my son. I tried the sea foods and prawns was delicious!

The Glass Onion,"Vegetarian Review ~

Hopped in on a day before Holi for dinner and unfortunately it was a dry day. Survived with food that day. It's on the road to isb and is spread on a huge area with both outdoor and indoor seating arrangements while is outdoor has the view of the golf course and if the weather is great, this is the best place to be. Light music playing through the night was soothing.

We ordered lotus stem galouti with cheese kulcha, Korean waffle fries, veg penne Alfredo pasta and apple pie.

Lotus stem galouti - The galouti tasted great with the flavours of Vegetables and didn't taste much of lotus stem and went well with green chutney and cheese kulcha.

Waffle fries - The waffle had lot of honey, sesame and soy and garlic with a burnt taste. The waffle wasn't crispy and the didn't wasn't that great for my taste buds.

Alfredo pasta - The pasta was creamy and had all the veggies, the consistency was good and it tasted well overall.

Apple pie - This was star of the night for me with the pie tasted great with the falvours of apple and cardamom and the icecream was cheery on the cake and the whole dessert was mouth watering and heart filling.

The staff is good and friendly, I remember being the last one to exit and they were still nice. Keep up the good service. The whole order was around 1400 bucks which is a bit expensive for without alcohol but you get a dining experience and embience so good.

Overall a great place for some drinks and great conversation. Ideal for romantic dates and celebrations.

The Tilt Bar Republic,"Was here for a club party.

So, This place has an amazing ambience with dim Lighting, well equipped furniture & a large LCD screen & the light music just makes it perfect during a cricket match.

Well, Coming to food, I opted for a Veg buffet. The starters tasted really good specially the cheese garlic bread & ghee idly.

We had enough dishes in the main course & there were mocktails being served whenever asked, Raspberry tasted the best.

Deserts weren't that great. Vanilla scoops were just fine.

Overall, It seemed like a great place to hang out with a large crowd & also alone (Yes, for those cricket maniacs, you can just get yourself a beer & relax).

Either ways, it seemed at its best with proper space, lights, music & yaa, privacy.

I would rate:

Domino's Pizza,"Ordered a pizza, garlic bread and other stuff on 14th Feb at 9 pm through Zomato. ZOMATO shows order is in the kitchen. But no call, no delivery even by 10.15 pm. The branch number on Zomato was incorrect. Called up Dominos hotline and they said they'll reach out to the branch and they'll call back. Waited for 15 min. No call back. Called the hotline again and the guy puts me on hold while he reaches out to the branch. 5 min later i am disconnected. Called up again and the same message that they will reach out to the branch is thrown on my face. Finally had it enough and asked them to cancel my order and refund the money.

I anyway don't eat Dominos pizza given some pretty bad prior experience. But ordered on my wife's insistence. Congratulations. Now even my wife doesn't want to order Dominos ever again. :)

1. Zomato doesn't have any view on what the restaurant is doing with the order. The system automatically said food is being prepared when clearly the restaurant has no clue on the order.

Mathura Vilas,"Tried this place after a long time. The order was just a south indian thali, peas pulav, Mixed subzi chatpata and a Strawberry milkshake.
Arrived at the restaurant by 2.15 on a sunday afternoon. After a full 40 mins the first dish to be served was milkshake!! Will a restaurant serve side drink / dessert first, when the main course is yet to be served?

Service 1/5 - you will see waiters only while ordering the food, once the order is taken you wont even see them coming to your table even to serve water. You will see them standing in one corner of the restaurant, few walking in and out of the kitchen as if they are very busy. But no one will respond when you raise your hand/ or call for them. I literally had ti walk to them and ask for water.

Ambiance 1/5 -
Some kind of strange smell comes similar to the one you get in a dumped wet cloths
In short a worthless place.

Food quality and taste 1/5.
Coming to the quality of food - the peas pulav had just peas in them i hardly found rice!.
Very salty mixed subzi chatpata dish which just had onions and capsicum.
As mentioned before the food was served after 40 mins. The south indian thali had a sambar - it was a hot water in which dhal was washed and rasam was just hot water; when requested for a refill of bindi (it was the only dish that was nice), I was told that the dish got over unfortunately due to the time. I seriously wonder what took them 40 mins to serve, I have never had such a bad experience before in any restaurant of this level.

Value for money - 0.5/5

For these so called high quality dishes I had to pay around 900. In short i will not suggest this place at all.",0,"['tried', 'place', 'long', 'time', 'order', 'south', 'indian', 'thali', 'pea', 'pulav', 'mixed', 'subzi', 'chatpata', 'strawberry', 'milkshake', 'arrive', 'restaurant', 'sunday', 'afternoon', 'full', 'min', 'first', 'dish', 'serve', 'milkshake', 'restaurant', 'serve', 'side', 'drink', 'dessert', 'first', 'main', 'course', 'yet', 'serve', 'service', 'see', 'waiter', 'order', 'food', 'order', 'take', 'wont', 'even', 'see', 'come', 'table', 'even', 'serve', 'water', 'see', 'stand', 'one', 'corner', 'restaurant', 'walk', 'kitchen', 'busy', 'no', 'one', 'respond', 'raise', 'hand', 'call', 'literally', 'ti', 'walk', 'ask', 'water', 'ambiance', 'kind', 'strange', 'smell', 'come', 'similar', 'one', 'get', 'dump', 'wet', 'cloth', 'short', 'worthless', 'place', 'food', 'quality', 'taste', 'come', 'quality', 'food', 'pea', 'pulav', 'pea', 'hardly', 'find', 'rice', 'salty', 'mixed', 'subzi', 'chatpata', 'dish', 'onion', 'capsicum', 'mention', 'food', 'serve', 'min', 'south', 'indian', 'thali', 'sambar', 'hot', 'water', 'dhal', 'wash', 'rasam', 'hot', 'water', 'request', 'refill', 'bindi', 'dish', 'nice', 'tell', 'dish', 'get', 'unfortunately', 'due', 'time', 'seriously', 'wonder', 'take', 'min', 'serve', 'never', 'bad', 'experience', 'restaurant', 'level', 'value', 'money', 'call', 'high', 'quality', 'dish', 'pay', 'around', 'short', 'not', 'suggest', 'place']",tried place long time order south indian thali pea pulav mixed subzi chatpata strawberry milkshake arrive restaurant sunday afternoon full min first dish serve milkshake restaurant serve side drink dessert first main course yet serve service see waiter order food order take wont even see come table even serve water see stand one corner restaurant walk kitchen busy no one respond raise hand call literally ti walk ask water ambiance kind strange smell come similar one get dump wet cloth short worthless place food quality taste come quality food pea pulav pea hardly find rice salty mixed subzi chatpata dish onion capsicum mention food serve min south indian thali sambar hot water dhal wash rasam hot water request refill bindi dish nice tell dish get unfortunately due time seriously wonder take min serve never bad experience restaurant level value money call high quality dish pay around short not suggest place,0.03937504734004984,0.030260859701128684,0.9303640929588215
Barbeque Nation,"I almost forgot to write the review as I got too busy until I found these pictures in my gallery. I was here for a lunch with my colleagues last month. What a bad day it was. When you have already been to the place and have a nice set of expectations from the food. First of all, the presence of foreign particles in food questions the level of hygiene inside the kitchen. I was probably too lucky that day to have two such instances. I politely asked to replace the drink that was served. But things got too much for me when I found a hair in the crispy corn. When I put this into light to the serving staff, they just tried to take away the plate and all I got to listen was they will replace it. That’s what drove me mad. When I demanded to see the manager, he apologized and asked for the plate replacement. But I was done with the food now. No more nonsense. At the end, the manager showed up with a specially made choco-vanilla dessert(in pic).
Not just the hygiene, but the service was bad too. The team was all the time waiting for them to get the food.

Ambience was really good. We had experience of both indoor and outdoor dining. Outdoor dining truly outscored indoor experience.

Food was good but a bit higher on the price looking at portion size. We ordered Mediterranean platter, Bruschetta for vegetarians. The mocktails were nice.

It was couple of days before elections and apparently alcohol was not to be served. What really impressed me was that they followed rules. That's really good to see.

For main course we ordered a north indian combo, a very customised pasta and couple more things. They tasted good. Deserts were good but served delayed.

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,"As the name suggests, its supposed to be a Marriott and that's what you expect. The reality is very different.

Let's start with my experience even before reaching. I was advised to make a reservation for 2 people almost 3 days ahead to get a good place by the pool. And so I did.
I was denied reservation saying that it's really ""full"" but they finally said they can get me one table. I was happy.

It has a separate entrance in SLN terminus with it's own parking and valet which is real comfortable.
Now let's talk real business.

Upon Reaching I see the place completely empty. Maybe 2 tables were taken and rest were empty. I didn't understand why they had to do play so hard to get. Even by the time we left, the place was hardly even half full. The whole inside area was empty and few tables taken outside.

Ambience : the only thing good about it is the ambience but its not as grand as people suggest. It's very mediocre.

Staff: THE WORST SERVICE EVER. I have had better service in small restaurants or even small Dhabas if I may compare them. I had to call waiting staff for 10 mins for everything and they took their happy time to come. There is an inside seating and outside, we took the inside because it was too noisy out.

I asked one waiter why the service was so bad and he very rudely replied to me ""Andar koi nahi baithta"" (No one sits inside)
If you didnt have plans to serve people inside then why did you keep the damm place open?

There was a buffet and we went for it, now they kept a live counter open in the buffet with no chef there. We had to again wait for the waiting staff to notice us calling them, they then had to go call the chef who again took his jolly time to come and prepare what he was supposed to.

Being a Marriott, you'd expect some decent service they said if I'm paying with card I have to come to the billing counter and pay there. Such behaviour does not warrant prices at par with any 5 star hotel.

Food: There was hair in the food. Starters were okay but main course was very bad. And let me make special note of the dessert.

If I'm coming for a buffet in such a place, I'd expect to have desserts made by them and not bought from the local sweet shop. They bought kaaju kathli, Rasgulla, Some barfi among some cake etc. And no spoons to take them, had to again wait for staff to come give us spoons to take some dessert.

Next to the dessert counter there were dirty clothes kept in plain view. I've attached pictures

After paying when we were leaving someone tried to come and ask us how our evening went. When we tried to Express our grief, that waiter/manager just blatantly shut me off. I'm not paying for you to shut me off when you asked me how it was in the first place.

It was the most disappointing experience I ever had in Hyderabad. Marriott has to get its game straight and take some serious action in this property. I will for sure NEVER come here again and will also not let my friends waste their money here.",0,"['name', 'suggest', 'suppose', 'marriott', 'thats', 'expect', 'reality', 'different', 'let', 'start', 'experience', 'even', 'reach', 'advise', 'make', 'reservation', 'people', 'almost', 'day', 'ahead', 'get', 'good', 'place', 'pool', 'deny', 'reservation', 'say', 'really', 'full', 'finally', 'say', 'get', 'one', 'table', 'happy', 'separate', 'entrance', 'sln', 'terminus', 'park', 'valet', 'real', 'comfortable', 'let', 'talk', 'real', 'business', 'upon', 'reach', 'see', 'place', 'completely', 'empty', 'maybe', 'table', 'take', 'rest', 'empty', 'didnt', 'understand', 'play', 'hard', 'get', 'even', 'time', 'leave', 'place', 'hardly', 'even', 'half', 'full', 'whole', 'inside', 'area', 'empty', 'table', 'take', 'outside', 'ambience', 'thing', 'good', 'ambience', 'not', 'grand', 'people', 'suggest', 'mediocre', 'staff', 'bad', 'service', 'ever', 'well', 'service', 'small', 'restaurant', 'even', 'small', 'dhabas', 'may', 'compare', 'call', 'wait', 'staff', 'min', 'everything', 'take', 'happy', 'time', 'come', 'inside', 'seat', 'outside', 'take', 'inside', 'noisy', 'ask', 'one', 'waiter', 'service', 'bad', 'rudely', 'reply', 'andar', 'koi', 'nahi', 'baithta', 'no', 'one', 'sit', 'inside', 'didnt', 'plan', 'serve', 'people', 'inside', 'keep', 'damm', 'place', 'open', 'buffet', 'go', 'kept', 'live', 'counter', 'open', 'buffet', 'no', 'chef', 'wait', 'wait', 'staff', 'notice', 'u', 'call', 'go', 'call', 'chef', 'take', 'jolly', 'time', 'come', 'prepare', 'suppose', 'marriott', 'youd', 'expect', 'decent', 'service', 'say', 'im', 'pay', 'card', 'come', 'billing', 'counter', 'pay', 'behaviour', 'not', 'warrant', 'price', 'par', 'star', 'hotel', 'food', 'hair', 'food', 'starter', 'okay', 'main', 'course', 'bad', 'let', 'make', 'special', 'note', 'dessert', 'im', 'come', 'buffet', 'place', 'id', 'expect', 'dessert', 'make', 'not', 'bought', 'local', 'sweet', 'shop', 'buy', 'kaaju', 'kathli', 'rasgulla', 'barfi', 'among', 'cake', 'etc', 'no', 'spoon', 'take', 'wait', 'staff', 'come', 'give', 'u', 'spoon', 'take', 'dessert', 'next', 'dessert', 'counter', 'dirty', 'clothes', 'keep', 'plain', 'view', 'ive', 'attach', 'picture', 'pay', 'leave', 'someone', 'try', 'come', 'ask', 'u', 'even', 'go', 'tried', 'express', 'grief', 'waitermanager', 'blatantly', 'shut', 'im', 'not', 'pay', 'shut', 'ask', 'first', 'place', 'disappoint', 'experience', 'ever', 'hyderabad', 'marriott', 'get', 'game', 'straight', 'take', 'serious', 'action', 'property', 'sure', 'never', 'come', 'also', 'not', 'let', 'friend', 'waste', 'money']",name suggest suppose marriott thats expect reality different let start experience even reach advise make reservation people almost day ahead get good place pool deny reservation say really full finally say get one table happy separate entrance sln terminus park valet real comfortable let talk real business upon reach see place completely empty maybe table take rest empty didnt understand play hard get even time leave place hardly even half full whole inside area empty table take outside ambience thing good ambience not grand people suggest mediocre staff bad service ever well service small restaurant even small dhabas may compare call wait staff min everything take happy time come inside seat outside take inside noisy ask one waiter service bad rudely reply andar koi nahi baithta no one sit inside didnt plan serve people inside keep damm place open buffet go kept live counter open buffet no chef wait wait staff notice u call go call chef take jolly time come prepare suppose marriott youd expect decent service say im pay card come billing counter pay behaviour not warrant price par star hotel food hair food starter okay main course bad let make special note dessert im come buffet place id expect dessert make not bought local sweet shop buy kaaju kathli rasgulla barfi among cake etc no spoon take wait staff come give u spoon take dessert next dessert counter dirty clothes keep plain view ive attach picture pay leave someone try come ask u even go tried express grief waitermanager blatantly shut im not pay shut ask first place disappoint experience ever hyderabad marriott get game straight take serious action property sure never come also not let friend waste money,0.03396271169869684,0.03457394596167474,0.9314633423396286

The Old Madras Baking Company,"We had gone to Old Madras Baking Company in the past for buying bread but never sat down and had a meal there. We were out on a Saturday morning to check out a house right opposite this place. It was raining and my husband wanted to have some coffee and that is how we landed up here. The place is very chilled out, there was no one at our table to check what we wanted to order despite the place being almost empty.

My husband placed the order for us,a mushroom omelette for me and a roasted mushroom makhani sandwich for him. I'm usually not a coffee person but the weather demanded a hot beverage and filter coffee was the first thing that came to my mind. We ordered 2 filter coffees and 1 bagel with cream cheese. The bagel was amazing with the coffee. I'm not a big fan of cream cheese but my husband is and he loved it. We made a pact to go for breakfast every Saturday mornings after this because I realised what an important meal I was missing due to my laziness :)

Would recommend this place to everyone for sure. I for sure am going back again for the bagels and coffee!",1,"['go', 'old', 'madras', 'bake', 'company', 'past', 'buy', 'bread', 'never', 'sit', 'meal', 'saturday', 'morning', 'check', 'house', 'right', 'opposite', 'place', 'rain', 'husband', 'want', 'coffee', 'land', 'place', 'chill', 'no', 'one', 'table', 'check', 'want', 'order', 'despite', 'place', 'almost', 'empty', 'husband', 'place', 'order', 'usa', 'mushroom', 'omelette', 'roast', 'mushroom', 'makhani', 'sandwich', 'im', 'usually', 'not', 'coffee', 'person', 'weather', 'demand', 'hot', 'beverage', 'filter', 'coffee', 'first', 'thing', 'come', 'mind', 'ordered', 'filter', 'coffee', 'bagel', 'cream', 'cheese', 'bagel', 'amazing', 'coffee', 'im', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'cream', 'cheese', 'husband', 'love', 'make', 'pact', 'go', 'breakfast', 'every', 'saturday', 'morning', 'realise', 'important', 'meal', 'miss', 'due', 'laziness', 'would', 'recommend', 'place', 'everyone', 'sure', 'sure', 'go', 'back', 'bagel', 'coffee']",go old madras bake company past buy bread never sit meal saturday morning check house right opposite place rain husband want coffee land place chill no one table check want order despite place almost empty husband place order usa mushroom omelette roast mushroom makhani sandwich im usually not coffee person weather demand hot beverage filter coffee first thing come mind ordered filter coffee bagel cream cheese bagel amazing coffee im not big fan cream cheese husband love make pact go breakfast every saturday morning realise important meal miss due laziness would recommend place everyone sure sure go back bagel coffee,0.029935430523423935,0.033589967312233356,0.936474602164343

Marsala Food Company,"The food of the place was nice except for ‘Murg Malai Tikka’, the dish was very sweet and not worth for money. The reason for giving 1 star rating is my experience in the restaurant which was not only food but also the staff which were very very rude not only while serving food but also while taking order and explaining certain dishes which were named differently on the menu.

Deli 9 Bistro,"Deli9 has a lots of good food to offer and that's why I flock the place pretty frequently. My favorite here is their Pan Fried Fish steak sizzler (if you are not a fan of sizzlers, request them and they would serve it sans the fanfare). Tried their grilled tenderloin steak as well, but it did not live upto the expectations. It was dry and chewy sadly. Their pastas are quite tasty (we tried ours in pink sauce), so are their pizzas (we tried garden veg). If you like fish and chips, try it out here, will not be disappointed. Their cold coffee isn't that great, bitter and watery (I like the creamy and balanced kind). If you like mocktails, I would suggest that you leave out the Ginger Lime fizz.

We visited this place for dinner. The weather was freezing cold, i was craving some hot soup.
We ordered chicken manchow soup and lemon coriander soup. The soups were perfect for a freezing cold evening.
Comming to the mocktails the virgin colada, chatpata madness and sex on the beach were very soothing.
Starters were delicious we had
Hyderabadi tawa fish which was so much flavourful.
Lahsuni paneer tikka was so smooth and melting in mouth.
Tandoori broccoli was my favourite from this place.

Labonel,"#BrownieLove  # BakedWithLove

Classic calm interior. I loved their theme color ""Blue"". Packaging is sober and royal, an excellent house warming present. 

Brownies were soft, chocolaty and yum yum yum. They were simply the best. 
One has to buy a complete box of 15 piece medium sized square brownie. Rs 700 for box of brownie which will last for 4-5 days, per brownie it costs ~50. Good deal for a group of 6-7 people however not so good deal for single person/loner. 
Place an order in advance for assorted box of brownie. 

Suggestion: 
I don't want to go and eat chocoLava in Dominos on cheat day, instead i want to have Brownie here. 
Why not offer a single piece or small one person box (3-4 pieces may be).",1,"['brownielove', 'bakedwithlove', 'classic', 'calm', 'interior', 'love', 'theme', 'color', 'blue', 'packaging', 'sober', 'royal', 'excellent', 'house', 'warm', 'present', 'brownie', 'soft', 'chocolaty', 'yum', 'yum', 'yum', 'simply', 'best', 'one', 'buy', 'complete', 'box', 'piece', 'medium', 'size', 'square', 'brownie', 'r', 'box', 'brownie', 'last', 'day', 'per', 'brownie', 'cost', 'good', 'deal', 'group', 'people', 'however', 'not', 'good', 'deal', 'single', 'personloner', 'place', 'order', 'advance', 'assort', 'box', 'brownie', 'suggestion', 'dont', 'want', 'go', 'eat', 'chocolava', 'domino', 'cheat', 'day', 'instead', 'want', 'brownie', 'not', 'offer', 'single', 'piece', 'small', 'one', 'person', 'box', 'piece', 'may']",brownielove bakedwithlove classic calm interior love theme color blue packaging sober royal excellent house warm present brownie soft chocolaty yum yum yum simply best one buy complete box piece medium size square brownie r box brownie last day per brownie cost good deal group people however not good deal single personloner place order advance assort box brownie suggestion dont want go eat chocolava domino cheat day instead want brownie not offer single piece small one person box piece may,0.04052711078821275,0.03456773527702804,0.9249051539347592

The Chocolate Room,"The chocolate room, I think the name itself is a like a bliss for chocoholics. Well, it was around 6 in the evening & I wasn't even hungry so I had to order something light.

I ordered for a KitKat milkshake.

Club Rogue,"The worst place in the city, I was here for a few drinks with my friends and it was during the happy hours (which is till 6pm) and they were so adamant in taking our order at 5.50 stating happy hours were closed, we had to literally tell them that we were still in happy hours to ask for that price, surprisingly they didn't like it and the drinks were diluted. What surprised me the most was that they were serving everything in plastic glasses? Like seriously? Serve drinks in a plastic glass? When speaking to the waiter he said - go to 10D they serve drinks in glasses and not plastic, it was so rude for him to say that. I asked him to call his manager and told him the story to which he says his boss asked to serve in plastic glasses and kept explaining that it was his boss's order, he was just not able to understand what I was explaining to him - I bigger issue was about the way the waiter had spoken to me and when even after sometime I realised he was not interested in what I was saying, I was furious and used F word to which he said you can use F word but we are also very dangerous people? Like what dangerous? He was absolutely okay with me writing this review as they felt they didn't have any obligation towards customer service. It was not something they were giving me for free and to compensate he was willing to give me discount and also call the waiter to apologies to me - I didn't need someone's apology - what matters the most is their service and looks like it does not appear anywhere on their list of how to sustain in the business.

there is no welcome drink. Even an ordinary restaurant offers at least a grape juice.
Starters : cold, not fresh, tasteless and very hard to eat. VEG: potato, Baby corn. Non-Veg : chicken, Fish
not even a smell of Prawns or mutton in any corner out of whole menu.
main course : only 2 biryanis (veg n chicken). and just a paneer curry and chicken curry with some fancy namedesserts :
ice creams only strawberry n chocolate flavors which are semi solid n turns to liquid by the team you eat it.

Pakwaan Grand,"I and my colleague missed our lunch due to the work load and was craving for something tasty. It was 3 in the noon and we planned to order some curry and started since both of us brought mains from home. Hence, we wanted to try something we haven't had before, and zeroed on Pakwaan Grand.

Checked out the menu and found Chicken Afghani, Pepper chicken to be their favorites. Ordered these, though ZOMATO, however, ZOMATO RUINED IT with delivery part the food was worth the wait.

The Chicken Afghani was spicy and went well with steamed rice. The pepper chicken was bit over fried, however, tasty with right blend of species.

The gravy was unique because i had Chicken Afghani in other restaurants but Pakwaan has their own way of presenting it.

Overall it was a wholesome meal for 2 of us.

NorFest - The Dhaba,"Have been there several times and have opted for delivery too.

They serve pretty good authentic North Indian food. Mutton Rogan Josh, Butter Chicken and Dal Makhni are top notch. Very flavorful and authentic.

Galaouti Kebabs are by far the best item in the menu.

Story goes that one particular Nawab of Lucknow, who was an infamous couch potato, had lost the use of his dentures and was looking for something pate style, which needed no chewing yet imparted the flavors of a fine kebab. So Galaouti‘s were invented.

And the mutton Galaouti’s served here, are exactly like mentioned above. Very soft not much chewing required, they just melt in the mouth. They are served with ulta tawa paratha's and is a must must try.

Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,"I have been here for breakfast. Its a huge spread as other 5 star properties usually have, but I saw a great variety and different kind of a menu here. For me, a waffle cart was the best part. I just loved the hot and crispy waffles with maple syrup, nutella and berries compost. Do ask for a chef's special. The breakfast option with the stay is a must pick and do try as much as possible from the spread.
A few other things which I liked were the baked potatoes. Just loved them.
Another good thing about them was that they did not cut the fruits beforehand. You had to select your choice and they were cut right in front of you. In the juices section, I could remember a carrot 🥕 ginger, tulsi, aloevera and many such. Detox water was another addition. Apart from these, you could chose the fruits and veggies you wanted and they would make a fresh juice right in front of you.

Pista House,"I am so disappointed with what I just had today from Pista House, Gachibowli, that I don't think it would be sensible on my part to even award a single star rating, but unfortunately, zomato is not allowing me to publish the review without rating , hence this 1 star.

I have had Mutton Kheema Biriyani earlier from Pista House - Kondapur & Nizampet, both of which were awesome and of the same taste & make, however, the same didn't turn true for Kheema biriyani from the Gachibowli outlet.  All my friends who had the biriyani today shares the same opinion, so, I am not being overly critical at all. I don't understand, how such reputed brands/chain do not maintains consistency of taste & recipe across all the outlets, they do maintain consistency with the prices though..

Not sure, if Pista House would be be even interested to take this comment seriously OR act upon it to get things better for next time, but, at least I request that they don't cheat on their customer's expectations.

What was bad with the biriyani -

1. It was all rice and no kheema
2. This is NOT at all the same recipe that is being served in other outlets (Nizampet & Kondapur)
3. Trivial though - but the packaging is also inconsistent as compared to other outlets ( while other outlets packs in Container , Pista House - Gachibowli deliver in foil packet )

Shanghai Chef 2,"I had high expectations of this restaurant but was dissapointed. I sometimes ponder to visit them again, because as per user reviews they are good.

The seating is well, the air conditioning is not. Its either chilly or completely stopped. You cant help it.

The servers are less and even being a small place, you have to shout to catch their attention.

The food. Oh God! I dont know what happened with the chef that day, but he had put spinach in all of my dishes and that too in huge quantities. They were wreaking havoc on the plate and we had to leave a dish totally for that matter.

So many wrongs, bounds me to visit them once again to see whether they are like this all the time or was I unfortunate to visit them on their bad day. They also need a experienced manager.

Butter roti- made full of maida and instead of butter, it seems like used edible oil was recycled for these so called rotis. They should call it a naan actually
Salad- carrot was rotten and not too sure who asked you to provide them anyways
Paneer - it is so much stale and so hard to chew. Am sure it has exceeded it's expiry date.
Dal makhani - this was good and loved it. (The only.item in entire meal which I liked)
Mix vegetable - it's only beans with gravy which tastes awful
Mix raita - while the curd part was good, the boondi used was really so stale and it tastes like grease.

Club Rogue,"I went to club rouge since the day it started,I have been to this place more than 150 times.It was like a hangout place for us to always go.It was beautiful in the starting,less crowd and only couples were allowed to dance floors and people dint stand on tables and all that time to dance.Bouncers were pretty good at that time and the manager at that time was also very nice and polite.In the past few months since the manager changed,his name is siddharth the club rougue we knew was no more there.This angry little manager is the worst human u could ecer talk to.Single girls beware to go to this place.They allow cheap bastards into the club who doesn't drink and doesn't even have a table,they keep roaming all around the club to find girls and talk with them or make em uncomfy by staring at them and not moving from there table.I even saw a guy putting a tablet into some girls drink.Coming to my incident,Yesterday i went to this place to watch afternoon ipl match which was at 4.We went there at 5 and it was happy hours,which we don know or never cared about happy hours in clubs.We started watching match and at 6 a waiter comes saying pls pay bill since happy hours is ended.We said okay and we paid.Now the waiter says please leave, we were like wtf we came to watch the match and we will leave only after it's done.Then he calls the manager.His name is SIDDHARTH.This guy is one horrible crap who thinks since he is the manager of the club he's an avenger superhero.He came to us and said which a very tone u people have to leave,I told that's not happening we are hyderabadi's and it's srh match and we will leave only when it's done and he started shouting and telling no with so much attitude.Later he said 30mins and left.He wasn't coming when I was calling him also.He comes after 30mins and says go,When we told we will not leave until the match is done he told he will call bouncers and make us leave,We were so frustrated and angry we told call them and let them decide who's wrong here.Then he told that club rougue owner(MD) is NARSINGH RAO and he is a big local goon and he threatened us that once u leave this place some unknown people will come and hit and break our bones if we say anything to SIDDHARTH (the manager).People go to clubbing to have fun and in the end all we got was a life threat.And moreover this place became a sick place,it stinks and waiters will force u to give more tip saying 2 ppl served u and all.And the cheap guy stags who come inside with influence and think they are hottest models 😂.Sorry for the long review but i think they deserve it.The manager SIDDHARTH.SIDDHARTH.SIDDHARTH Thanks for making me realize that i should never come back to club rougue and make bills around 20k each time I visit the club.And thanks for making me realize that I should not suggest this place to anyone.His name is SIDDHARTH and the he is HERO of club rougue.",0,"['go', 'club', 'rouge', 'since', 'day', 'startedi',

Marsala Food Company,"Today I visited this place along with a few friends.Located at the third level of a building right opposite DLF it is at an easily reachable location.The lift opens into a foyer followed by a lobby.The dining area has many seating options both low seating and normal tables too.One can view the never ending traffic outside from the low tables.The ambience is good.The place is dimly lit with pretty lamps and decorative lights.
Now coming to the food I felt the food was mostly good with only some exceptions.
We started with soups.We had the Arabian Chicken Soup and the Lemon corriander soup.The Arabian Chicken Soup was a smooth and mild soup also it wasn't that thick too.On the other hand the Lemon Corriander soup was real thick and was more spicier and had a freshness to it.Also it had baby corn, carrots, beans and such which made it even more better.
Next we had starters.Chicken Pahadi- The pahadi kebabs have all herbs as flavouring agents instead of the normal khara masalas we generally use.The pahadi kababs they serve here is really good.The flavouring was fresh and chicken was tender and easily coming apart with a slight touch of the fork.Next we had Paneer Papdi Kebab.This is batter fried paneer slices.The batter and it's seasoning was good but inside the paneer should also have had some seasoning but the paneer was bland which spoils an otherwise great dish.Kung Pao Mushroom was okayish.It tasted almost like manchurian and lacked the normal roasted peanuts which you find generally in Kung Pao dishes.Dragon chicken and Hariyali Fish Tikka both were amazing.I do recommend these.Golden Fried prawns were good but they were batter fried which took away that 'prawn' taste.It was good but did not feel like having prawns.Golden fried Baby corn was also good.Chilli Paneer was disappointing.The paneer was not soft and the dish just did work out.Lahori Chicken Kabab was also pretty good.Mushroom Moti Tikki is something I would avoid.I did not like it but I feel this is a dish that one person might love while the other will just hate it.It is khova filled mushrooms.I could not eat it and so I am not recommending this but you could give it a try.What if you are a sweet filled mushroom kinda person.
Next we had Mandis.The juicy mutton mandi was good but my favourite has to be the Chicken Mandi.The rice of the Mandis was flavourful and filled with caramelized onions and nuts.The fried chicken served with the mandi was just pure awesomeness.The pieces are fried and then again tossed with some sauces to give it a unique taste.The Fish mandi was also served with a very tasty fried fish piece.The fish was very flavourful and is definitely worth a try.The best Mandi you ask then definitely go for the Chicken Mandi.
We also had some milkshakes- KitKat,Butterscotch and Strawberry.I loved the KitKat Milkshake the most.It had chunks of KitKat in it and is served with a scoop of chocolate icecream.The milkshakes are good but they are nothing extraordinary.
Now coming to desserts. I was not that satisfied with the desserts.The Kaddu ki Kheer was really good.We also had Double ka Meetha which I feel was too dry and a bit hard too.Also the Gulab Jamuns also could improve a bit.They were not bad but not really good too.We also had Qubani ka Meetha which was okay.
Overall I would say most of the non veg starters were good and the Mandis too are good.The desserts need improvement.The place is definitely worth a visit.",1,"['today', 'visit', 'place', 'along',

Other than beer, I’ve tried their LIT and a classic martini!
They’ve got quite a nice ambience for a sports bar.
Food was delicious.
I’ve tried their sizzling non veg tikka platter where you get to choose 3 varieties from their whole kebabs menu!
As per the guy who served us, Jamaican and Nasheman was their speciality.
So we ordered that platter with Jamaican, Nasheman and Malai fish tikka.
Jamaican: 4/5 (more of a spicy tandoor)
Nasheman:3/5 (lame and tasteless)
Malai Fish:4/5 (loves the soft malai fish)

The Tilt Bar Republic,"Lovely European Bar with probably the best drinks hyderabad has to offer (No exaggeration)

Most of the drinks they have are imported from Europe and are supposedly not found any where else across India.

They also serve Trappist beers which are basically drinks brewed by monks for a charitable cause
And they also claim that all their booze is glycerine free without any preservatives and won't give you a beer belly

Everything aside they officially serve the smoothest drinks in town and I can vouch for that!!!! They're pricey but worth it!!!

Drinks-
Beer: La trappe Trippel (Bottled)
Witte
Beer sampler- (The caramel and cherry ones were my favorite)
Dubbel
Belgian Kreik
Chamborlette
Erdinger Weisbier
Erdinger Dunkel
Schuimpzuiper
Miss spicy - They mean it when they say spicy
Barbar blond (bottled)

Jenever shots (Pronounced yenever) (20% alcohol)
A type of Dutch Gin produced only in Europe with juniper flavour

These were absolutely amazing
The smoothest shots I've ever had

Smeets bessen Jenever - fruity gin with a sweet base
Citroen Jenever- Citrus flavoured shots with a tangy, zesty taste
Wafel Jenever- Hands down the best shot I've had. Ever.
Tastes like waffle syrup. Notes of caramel and pop corn. Sweet, smooth and simply sublime

Project 51- Brandy cocktail with notes of cinnamon and spicy jalapenos

Mango mint mocktail- Super sweet mango flavoured drink with a mildly minty taste

Food

Food was pretty good. We tried
Lasooni Murgh
Lamb chops - Tender and well cooked
Fries
Cheese broccoli- creamy cheesy broccoli
Florentine saute mushrooms
Chickpea corn masala - Good stuff to munch on while having drinks. Had alot of Peanuts.
Cilantro grilled fish- Tasted pretty Indian
Grilled fish with rice - Recommended
Saucy chest nuts
Chilli garlic prawns - Not very garlicky or spicy
Veg assorted pizza- Pretty good for a bar
Choco lava cake

The food wasn't too oily or spicy. Well flavoured and served warm.

Over all rating- 4.5/5 ( Only because there pricey)

Marsala Food Company,"It was a lunch and was very hungry thought to head towards this place.
.
.

The place is quite good with spacious sitting area and decent ambience.
.
.
There are many varities available to eat where its mojitos, soups, starters, maincourse and the desserts not to forget the softdrinks the most important thing.
.
.
Had started with the lemon corriander souo and the arabian chicken soup....the best liked by me us the lemon corriander where the flavour of each ingeredient used to make the soup was felt in each sip.
..
..
Then the best to go with is the starters which includes the variety of eatables like fish hariyali, paneer papdi kabab which was good but less salt, lahori chicken kabab which was just awesom to have the tastiest one I had in a very long time, then comes the marg achari tikka which is again can stand against lahori kabab, then fish 65 was good , the golden fried babycorn which was so srumptious and welked fried ,then the veg sheek kabab which was the worst thing I tried honestly was not at all cooked properly no salt no chilli just wet piece of vegetables felt in mouth could not even eat that.
..
..
Then went ahead with prawns which was good ,then comes the crispy corn chilli pepper which was again a good one to go with.
..
..
The main course had the mouth waterting fish and mutton mandi which was really good but can be more organised if served more hot...the fish and mutton were cooked perefectly with soft texture felt......and not to forget the veg fried rice with manchuria again makes it fit to eat
..
..
Then had the virgin mojito and the kitkat shake which were perfectly made.
..
..
The most awaited and favourite part the dessert section
Which had the gulab jamun
The shahi tukda
The kuddi ki kheer
The khubani ka mittha.
...
...
Was happy and fulled after having this many varities of dishes.
..
..
Must visit this place to have a good experience of varities of different hyderabadi eatables.

The Old Madras Baking Company,"This place has freshly baked stuff, probably the best you'd find in this locality but the beverages are just about average!

The Danish custard and banana cake have made their place permanent in my orders since I am quite frequent here. All cheese puff had a very soft texture but came with a lot of chilli's. The mushroom spinach puff is good. Special omlette didn't really match my expectations here. For the main course, I've tried tuna melt sandwich, egg salad sandwich, double cheese margherita pizza, smoke chicken cherry and mushrooms pizza and red sauce pasta and all of them were good.

13 Dhaba,"We had been wanting to visit 13 Dhaba for quite some time, having heard the raving reviews about their North Indian preparations. Finally ended up trying their steaming hot, gobsmacking parathas and they're truly some of the best you can find in Hyderabad 😍

Flechazo,It is seldom you see a restaurant with 4.9 rating. My friend and I had come with great expectations. But the restaurant didn't manage to live up to any of it. Even the 2 rating is because the staff was very polite and we had no complains there. Coming to the food: the sushi isn't good. The chef isn't aware that you don't give mayonnaise on sushi but wasabi. The starters were okay and we didn't repeat anything. In spite of being non vegetarians the only item we liked was the crispy corn. Then in aglio olio they used macaroni. The main course had a terrible array of dishes. And none was good. The biriyani had no chicken. The couscous salad had just quinoa and olives. The chocolate ice cream had an overdose of milk. All in all a very forgettable experience.

I was optimistic enough to ignore consequences of only I among two of us decided to have buffet. Hope against hope perhaps, the guy said that we can't share from one buffet order.

Food was pathetic as well. Tanduri roti that we ordered was made of maida. And the dishes were either too oily or just bad.

Parathas were excessively oily. Paneer and tomato curries tasted awful. Everything tastes candy sweet. I couldn't eat any of it apart from a bite to just taste.

The meal was a complete let down.

The Foodie Monster Kitchen,"Delivery review
What I ordered - best of both worlds which is a combination of waffles and pancakes served with scrambled egg accompanied by choice of beverage which I choose tea
Price - 199 plus taxes.
Food review - the food was in general leaning towards healthy taste though it was not mentioned as such. The scrambled eggs were without any kind of spices and just tossed in butter. Pancake was nice and fluffy but the maple syrup was too less to enjoy it fully u can see the pics. Waffles tasted bland but may be coz it was just plain waffle and it was too hard thumbs down 👇. Tea was really nice and was warm enough and they provided a disposable cup which was quite cute. Special mention to the superb packaging and value for money which urged me to give an extra one star though the food was a 3 🌟🌟🌟 for me.

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,"Having heard a lot of hype surrounding this place, and the 4.5 rating on Zomato, it was on my wishlist for ages, but I was always skeptical of the taste, being too authentic and a totally new cuisine. The former proved to be true, and was the primary reason I didn't have a very pleasing dinner.

It's a small and cute little diner like Cafe, with minimalistic and soothing interiors. The sour smell of fermentation was nauseating initially, but I got used to it in just a few minutes. Some room freshener would do the trick.

The items are priced very cheap, I had high expectations, but only to learn later the portions are just too small. We had:

🍗 SPICY DRUMS OF HEAVEN (140/5) - The only thing I could properly finish. A typical batter fried chicken. Almost south Indian and spicy in taste, but the coating was too thick.

🍗 CHICKEN SUCCULENT YAKITORI (130) - 3 skewers with tiny chicken chunks, spring onion stem and a sesame seed drizzle. Texture was good, but taste, average. Sticky barbeque sauce coating it felt like.

🍗 CHICKEN MOMOS (130/5) - Standard, good amount of filling, with a very pungent ginger flavor. The coating was thick too. Chilli chutney served alongside was not too spicy, and went well with the Momos.

🐽 BOSAM (170) - It was my first time trying pork belly, and I can't really judge, but it felt fatty and gooey. The pieces were drenched in grease. Served with spicy kimchi which I loved.

🍜 CHICKEN RAMYUM NOODLES (180) - Big bowl of noodles, what looked like Maggi but was only a close resemblance. Scarce chicken pieces, undercooked, dry and hard noodles, and overall a very bland taste.

🐟 NAGA STEAM FISH (250) - This was the thing causing the smell in the restaurant. And I couldn't tolerate it. A very very pungent and strong odor. The fish had a great texture and was steamed to perfection. Served with steamed white rice.

Whatever I mentioned about the food, was just my impression, and maybe because it was the first time trying out this new cuisine, I didn't really like it.

However, one thing that was disappointing was the service. It was slow and just took ages. Once the food arrived, it was fine but again the bill took more than 20 minutes.

As many others have already said, I guess, the strong point of this place is their pork preparations, and I would recommend this place purely for that. An elaborate menu with lots of options, priced well.

Here's my overall SCORE:
Food - 3.5/5 (not judging what I tried first time/don't know about)
Ambience - 4/5 (get a room freshener!)
Service - 3/5

Three layers of BBQ chicken strips, a cheese slices and some lettuce. It's a nice tasting marinade but if only they didn't over cook it.
You keep the chicken juicy for that's what makes a burger. You'll need someone who understands the timing and temperature to keep the chicken juicy

The Glass Onion,"2 stars for the place for rest 3, need good food, service, presentation and experience

Lets start with the good part for which the two stars.

Ambience , location and the place is amazing nothing like other places in hyd. The rain today made it even better. Outdoor has this chil lounge vibe with good house music and indoor being this good energy family or dinner vibe.

Thats it to the place and good part!

Service was bad, food was ok. If a restaurant does not serve filter water it is a huge problem. Buying water is a choice not force. Doesn’t matter if you are local udipi or a five star. We were told we dont have filter water something is broken so you buy. While leaving we did see other tables served normal water.

We did have zomato gold to use, but the experience was not so great to use it. First turnoff , dont have kingfisher beers.

We ordered veg tandoor platter, margherita pizza , tiramisu and cheesecake.

Pizza was the best part and yet i would say a 3.5/5. Generous amount of sauce and cheese but 3 basil leaf to count. We asked for mustard and denied.

The platter had many things but of of which was paneer tikka n no grilled onion or peppers or tomato. Whole platter didnt come with any onion et al side. Extra chutney took forever to come.

Tiramisu was average will not try again or recommend

Cheesecake was pretty bad. Packed to throw i guess. The blueberry on it ...is red color which is super confusing. The creamcheese itself i would guess will be cheaper kind making it hard.

They gave a birthday brownie, Which frankly was average too. However, the server comes and tells me during payment, i have not charged you for brownie. WTF!!!!!

Overall i will recommend to go to njoy the place and have few drinks.

KS Bakers,"So, we had a combined birthday celebration for almost five people and housing a team of almost 50. We decided to order cake from KS Baker's. Following is my experience on the same-:

Presentation- Looked lovely and the gum paste flowers on it just made our mouths to water. The colour was sharp and had the perfect blend of black and white. The presentation was superb. 4/5

Delivery- Got everything delivered on time. Nothing outstanding. 3.5/5

Cake- Now this is what was actually not good enough. The black forest tasted much different than any other black forest.

Club Rogue,"We were there in a group of 9, for drinks last weekend. And we had the most horrible experience ever. Happy hours were till 7, but they were very reluctant to take any orders in the last 30min.We had to call them repeatedly, and then they came dragging their feet. When we were placing orders at 6:50pm, they said, it wasn't counted under happy hours. No explanation given. Shady ambience and very diluted drinks Food was OK. The worst part is that they were serving the drinks in plastic glasses, real shabby ones. We asked for proper glasses and they told us to go to 10D.. I mean.. Really?? Asking 9 customers to get lost?? We were unhappy with the server's response, and wanted to talk to the manager, who was even worse. He outrightly threatened us saying they were dangerous people and it would not be safe for us.. Really!?! LIKE REALLY???

Shanghai Chef 2,"The Overall Rating present for this restaurant doesn't justice the experience (will come to this in a bit)

So, a small almost cute little place tucked in first floor with ambient lightings turned on (to give romantic dinner table feel) and apt audible english chartbusters couldn't go any wrong with setup and restaurant proudly own this.
With this as a beginning, shanghai chef takes the dinning experience to whole new diff level which is confusing at its best. Waiters are surely not in the mood to offer appropriate tables to guests, not aware of all the food which is getting prepared in kitchen, not aware of all the 'Must Try' dishes of their own menu & most of all courtesy seems to have been left at the mercy of the servers. Like an example, since its not a fine dining we can't expect servers to serve your food left in the bowl again but same server at one table doing the same thing neglecting other tables left too much to be desired. This was the case, when a cockroach was found in one of the guests food and staff tried to avoid the scene blaming it to fate.
On the food side, crispy corn was good but avoid maonchow soup. Flat noodles also served just warm that too after enquiring multiple times.Also, Service takes the beating even if just half tables are filled.

So, coming back to first line.

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,"Instagram | veganyums_

Looking for a romantic dinner? I would say this is one of the best place in Hyderabad. Amazing ambience along the poolside. My review is based on the session invite.

We started our dinner with Thai coconut soup. Perfectly cooked veggies like carrot, broccoli, zucchini dipped into the coconut milk. It was very tasty.

In starters, we were served Beetroot paneer Tikka and Sikampuri kebab. Plating was very tempting. Paneer Tikka goes really well with the chutney they served with it. And the kebab, it was the best Sikampuri kebab I have ever had. Perfectly cooked and moist inside.

In mocktails, they suggested their best sellers which were apple cooler and minty mango. Apple cooler was little tangy and minty mango was on sweeter side. I just loved the latter one. It was very refreshing.

Then comes the main course. We had Malai kofta - modak shaped kofta layered with cashew curry. Sweetness was balanced and delicious in taste. Must try with their herb paratha. We also had Stuffed capsicum - one of the famous and ultimate dish in India. If you have only curry, you may find it salty, but have it with capsicum and you will feel it like a heaven.

For the first time I heard we do not provide glasses to serve water.

Even worse, for the first the I heard that we serve quarter plate/dinner plate only once on a table and even if it gets spoiled they won't change.

Diners Pavilion,"A go-to place in Gachibowli (especially for Team Lunches😃😃 ) since they have an amazing offer running now.
449/- AI for Veg and 549/- AI for Non Veg Buffet.

~Ambience (4.5/5)
The place looks pretty bright with a golden yellow theme Chandeliers and wooden furnitures...gives d place a Royal Feeling ✌️✌️

~Buffet Spread (4/5)
Coming to the buffet spread, I really loved the fresh and soothing welcome drink, probably cranberry juice it was.
As for the starters, there were so many options and service was good too even at the wee hours of a Friday Lunch afternoon.
I really loved the Cheese Broccoli, Crispy Corn and Chilli My among the veg ones.
And in my non veg options, Chicken hariyali Tikka, Fish Tikka were amazing.

Next comes the main course, although I was a little disappointed with so less variety of dishes here, but the starters already filled my hunger pangs and I could only taste some cucumber mayo salad and Some nicely cooked Chicken Dum Biryani with a an okayish Mutton Roganjosh.

Last but not the least, we ended our lunch with Hot Gulab Jamun along with vanilla ice cream. There were some cut fruits and butterscotch pastry too but they weren't that great.
Yet again a disappointment in Desserts Section!!😐😐😒

Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,"Yesterday, as always I went out for family dinner. We wanted to try something new. My wife searched for a highly rated restaurant and found this restaurant on Google. As I'm Sheraton/ Marriot Platinum member (42216744521/791050313) and had the best experience in past, I thought this would be a good choice. We booked the table. We started the food but soon we realized that we have made the worst decision of our life ever for restaurant selection. We opted to go with Buffet. There is definitely a great variety on the menu but the food was cold, not even warm. I did not like the food much. It was not even okay. As you would expect delicious and ravishing meals from Sheraton, that was not the case here. Only real-time cooked food was hot like pasta, roti. Anyway, we finished our food and came back. Now in the night, my younger son started vomiting and he was finding difficulties to digest water as well. The whole night he was vomiting. And, in the morning my wife stared do vomiting. We rushed to the hospital [Continatal] and the doctor clearly said it is food poising. We went to flashback and realized my wife and younger son had come vegetable team, which may have caused the vomiting. Eldor son had pasta so he was good. 
Very disappointing experience from Sheraton.
